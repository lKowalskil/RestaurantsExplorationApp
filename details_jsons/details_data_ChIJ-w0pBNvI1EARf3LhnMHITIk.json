No hello, no goodbye, no reaction at all, generally ignored. I have been working as a barista for more than three years, and this is the first time I have seen such an attitude. It would be nice if there was some kind of reaction, attention, smile, phrase... something... after such a desire to return there is no desire at all! I still didn't wait for the coffee.
