In the evening my friend and I decided to order rolls so that the price and size would be adequate. The operator said that delivery took up to an hour and a half, but in the end they delivered it in 2 hours, did not apologize and did not call. We ordered a set. I want to say right away that we are far from being picky, but I just love rolls, and I just tried these and didn‚Äôt eat them anymore. There is a lot of rice in each roll, you just eat it as if it were just rice, you don‚Äôt feel the filling at all. The soy sauce was diluted and simply no good, and besides, it was not clear what kind it was - it was in a vacuum transparent bag without a label, etc. It can be convenient, but it‚Äôs better in a bottle. By the way, there is not enough sauce either, although they allegedly brought us 3 servings. I took a specially cutaway photo of the salmon roll - it just smells like salmon in the literal sense of the word, it‚Äôs just a micron-sized piece. These rolls are also called Philadelphia with salmon. Some rolls actually contained some kind of mayonnaise, not cheese, and judging by the taste, it was cheap. The photo on the website is one thing, but in reality it is something else. I do not advise. If you want to save as much as possible and eat something like rolls, take it. If you want to eat delicious food and get high, this is not the place for you. I won't order again.
