The typical dehodorant smell is very invasive and definitely spoils the experience.\nMenu and prices: it's certainly not a cheap place. hot dogs set (dog, fries, drink - juice or soda) from 145 uah as well as burgers... yet you cannot order a simple dog and a drink, which means that asking for a milkshake (which they will sell to you as a desert) will be additional (it costs by menu 10 uah more). not drinking juice or sodas I've ordered a water; a glass of tap water is what i was served...\nAbout the food...\nDog (cheese): good hot dog. The only thing is that they don't grate the cheese on top, and being sliced they make it melt by puting everything in the microwave. But tasty nonetheless.\nFries: good and crispy\nSyrniki (cottage cheese pancakes): good. like syrniki.\nService: hardly competent. first waiter was a trainee and after the 3rd question we asked he gave up amd another more experienced waiter joined the discussion. This is the guy who couldnt even explain what flavor the milkshake was, and was estranged to the fact that i wanted it as main drink to my dog. In general not a state of the art service.\nThe shake - although i ordered without any kind of syrup - came with a berries syrup and was not a classic shake if you know your shakes, but was ok.\nOverall if u want a quick dog and you happen to be in podil, this is a place where u can get it. but if you are flexible i personally would rather go to the mini van that sells shawarma! u will eat well, fast and pay much less.\nIn conclusion, the ultimate feeling is that we ate in a toilet! 🙈🙈🙈", "time": 1539369294, "translated": false}, {"author_name": "Hans-Henrik S.
