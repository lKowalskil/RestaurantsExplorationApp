time whether to order or not.

But unfortunately, I was disappointed here too. When ordering a Philadelphia roll with smoked salmon, I received a classic Philadelphia roll with raw salmon. If you run out of smoked salmon at the point, you should not put it raw, but warn the guest that this is the situation, and not think that I won’t see the difference. Also 3 business lunches. Ayashi's role burned. I myself worked for a year in a sushi wok, although I worked in a franchise, but I had heard well what a sushi wok chain is and what kind of control there is. But the network frustrates me more and more. It’s a shame, but wok sushi used to be really good and the dishes were interesting. Prepared quickly. But this is because apparently the sushi wok no longer works for quality, but for quantity.
