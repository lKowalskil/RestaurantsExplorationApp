So for understanding, only a small part of popular songs that are not: All Alegrova, Monatik and so on...\nNot working microphones. Strange arrangement of the audio system in the hall (one speaker). Honestly speaking, the impression is that the “equipment” (speaker + 2 broken microphones) was taken from OLH, with the note that I will give it away for free.\n\nMenu.\nTOP popular positions are missing. If you're driving, sorry, just a minivan. Fortunately, they agreed to make a mixture of Sprite and syrup for the price of a Mojito.\nThe most expensive item on the menu, a set for a company. We have never seen anything like this before. There are not enough words to describe how deplorable this plate is, from its appearance, and even more so from its taste.\n\nIn one of the photos, our table, with an order amount of 950 UAH + 100 karaoke (not counting the plate of appetizer, which was already taken away).\n\nFor the Owner. I am sure that you are still paying rent, since you launched recently. But people will not return to you. This is not the right position in building a business when you make a weak menu and a maximum price. Come to your senses before you go broke.\n\nOur position, this was the first and last time we visited you. We won’t come ourselves, but we’ll give it to our friends as anti-advertising.
