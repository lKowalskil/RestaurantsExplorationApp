Yesterday, March 7, 2024, we booked a table for two. We were asked to immediately announce what we would order, well, ok, we said. They came today at 18.50 (the table was reserved for 19.00). They sat down in a dark hall where karaoke is played. There was a company that played Russian songs on the karaoke equipment (laptop, speakers) of the institution. Question for the institution, are you in Ukraine at all? Ok, we moved to another hall, where it is quieter. At 19.15 they brought us soup, I asked for a vase for flowers (because I was with flowers, March 8 anyway). The waiter promised to bring it. They reminded us about the pour that we pre-ordered. They could have brought it right away when we arrived, it seems like there is no need to cook it))) We are waiting, there is no and there is no. My boyfriend went to the bar because he was already getting impatient. We sit, look at the bottle, and who knows what to drink from üòê We wait for 10, 15, 20 minutes. Quietly. In an institution where there are three halls, three tables are occupied (it is with us). At 19.45 on the clock - no glasses, no vases, no steaks. My boyfriend went to the bar, paid for the first courses, brought back the bottle. And you think the waiter asked - what happened? why are you leaving Why didn't they wait for the steaks and return the bottle? Stupidly silently paid for two soups and that's it ü§£ Customer orientation is simply zero. This establishment and its waiter (who, by the way, didn't even introduce himself) ruined our evening. And this is Podil, the prices are the same as in institutions of a decent level (for example, Caesar - UAH 300, Solyanka - UAH 200). Now it became clear why the institution has such a poor landing, especially in such a district, on a Friday, a holiday. If it were possible to give a score, it would be a hefty zero. Therefore, if you want to spoil your day, listen to Russian rap and seek self-service at restaurant prices - welkom to Kupala Night.
