On January 5, 2024, they were unable to purchase products at your Retroville shopping center. The reason is banal, there is no remainder of 200 hryvnias. The terminals were not working. To offer something additional is not an option. Take the money and \"fail\". The girl refused to give her name. The solution to the problem is to hide in the pantry. After waiting, a more experienced seller came out, who doesn't even know who they work with on the shift. Because we are stupid, we demand something. Can a person come from the street and start working at your facility? There is no constructive solution. Just a game of hide and seek. The basic thing that was required was an apology. But no. Who needs your customers? The only answer I got was \"We don't see the point in apologizing, because we are not to blame.\" Then accusations of throwing money. It's a pity, because I've never seen such a circus. First, make a place where you can put them, not a common table. It turns out that I threw it, not put it down. No one can watch the video because there are no rights. There are no leaders either. Writes on Instagram. It is a pity that the taste of your delicious buns is spoiled by your own employees, who are unable to sell them.", "time": 1704733038, "translated": true}, {"author_name": "Анна Лысенко", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107994031090841407665/reviews", "language": "en-US", "original_language": "ru", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjWjtKVMqORVKA-sbWbR8ufB7PgxQpZlV5eusq4dcxoDNiY=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo", "rating": 2, "relative_time_description": "2 months ago", "text": "An unpleasant situation happened, today (10.01) I went to place an order.
