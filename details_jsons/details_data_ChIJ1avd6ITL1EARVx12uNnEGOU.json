We ordered a Banquet for 16 people. We arrived 1.5 months early to agree on the menu and give a deposit. The banquet was scheduled for mid-December. In 2 days, we called the restaurant again to check whether everything was fine. We were assured that it was. The table was booked for 17:15. Arriving at 17:00 on the day of the banquet, we saw a completely empty table in the house that we had previously ordered. They called the administrator and spent an hour trying to find out what was unclear. They kept saying that it was us who called them the day before the banquet and refused. Of course, this did not happen. As it turned out later, other people from the neighboring house refused, there was a banquet for 8 people. But they confused and crossed us out. I think there is no need to describe all the horror that we experienced. The guests (16 people) gathered and waited on the street for an hour, let me remind you that it was the middle of December. There was no way out, and we agreed until they fix everything. And now about the correction, they moved all the food that was prepared for another banquet (for 8 people who refused) to our house. Of course, all this was not what we ordered 1.5 months in advance. Invited guests stand outside for an hour in the cold. Then they prepared other dishes for another 1-2 hours, because of course it was not enough for our company.\nConclusion: waiting outside for an hour in the cold, the dishes are not what we ordered. A completely spoiled holiday.\nAs compensation, they offered UAH 1,000 from the check. What?! For all this horror. I do not recommend, never order anything here.\nBy the way, before booking, I ordered a table by phone, then they made a mistake with the month of the celebration and booked us for another month. When we arrived they couldn't find our reservation. It turned out that it was not recorded there 🤯🤯🤯\nIf you want a spoiled holiday, this is the place for you!!", "time": 1708277330, "translated": true}], "serves_beer": true, "serves_breakfast": true, "serves_brunch": true, "serves_dinner": true, "serves_lunch": true, "serves_wine": true, "takeout": true, "types": ["restaurant", "food", "point_of_interest", "establishment"], "url": "https://maps.google.com/?cid=16508160873508248919", "user_ratings_total": 448, "utc_offset": 120, "vicinity": "Soborna Street, 18а, Petropavlivska Borshchahivka", "website": "http://instagram.com/seloiliydy_restoran", "wheelchair_accessible_entrance": true}, "status": "OK"}
