I woke up every day with a heavy feeling of emptiness, lack of motivation and powerlessness. Life was passing me by and I felt like I was losing control of my mood and emotions.\n\nOne day, feeling a special craving for solitude, I decided to take a walk. My steps led me to a beautiful place, to Volodya's garage. Volodymyr was always someone who knew what to say or how to help in a difficult moment.\n\nVolodymyr met me with a smile and a glass of beer, and invited me to his place. Vladimir's garage was full of various tools, the smell of grease and creative chaos, which clearly contrasted with the seriousness of my condition.\n\nI told Volodymyr about my problems, about the difficulty of every day and the loss of the meaning of life. Volodymyr answered, listening to me, but at the same time, taking action, pouring beer into a glass.\n\nVolodymyr offered to come more often, but I hesitated at first, but then agreed. Spending time in Volodymyr's garage changed my life, the creative atmosphere of the garage, working with hands, lifting glasses of beer, and the phrases \"Ivan, shine a light on me here\" began to change me. I felt my mind begin to find peace and my heart find joy.\n\nI recommend everyone to visit!", "time": 1709972350, "translated": true}, {"author_name": "Василий Ищук", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116512608061823532602/reviews", "language": "en-US", "original_language": "uk", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocJ_6CtqSVSAyZpWjSlS5J4zznsuvtIrVQi0bIVHb9ht=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo", "rating": 5, "relative_time_description": "3 months ago", "text": "Very nice place, good drinks and food, you can turn nuts and repair a car and taste alcohol.
