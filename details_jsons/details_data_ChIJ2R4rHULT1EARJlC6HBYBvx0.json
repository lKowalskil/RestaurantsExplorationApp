When asked if it would be possible to cover the nails with shellac in an hour, she just started cursing, got stuck in the conversation, started accusing me of asking incorrect questions, they just didn't finish the manicure.\nWhat it means to provide services still needs to be learned.\n\nI must note that I have been to this salon more than once, the previous times all the staff I met were friendly, everything was fine. The conflict arose when the \"director\" appeared in the salon during my procedure, which I clearly do not like as a client, I hope this is not harassment, it's just that you were in a bad mood.\nThank you very much for the previous manicure. And to the masters for their very careful work with my delicate cuticle. It is a pity that the problem lies with the management and not with the staff.\nI am writing this post so that others know and be prepared for possible aggression and accusations that they are not \"such\" clients as they wanted\n\nAnswer to the comment: I was polite and did not offend anyone. I'm sorry, I won't be silent when people make comments to me. And there is no need to press the pity that you are pregnant (it seems that if you are pregnant, then you can get upset with clients?) I am sincerely sorry that a woman in her position got into such a verbal altercation, if I had seen it, I would have done everything possible to protect her from this. But I am not going to tolerate insults and disrespect on my side. Therefore, this post is public. Who knows how many more you will stumble upon. I can also complain about the bad conditions, the state of health - but I don't do it. I am very sorry that I did not record our conversation on a voice recorder, because in that case you could have gone to court. I received a moral injury from this attitude and poor quality services. Don't distort the facts. No one insulted anyone. And I asked your colleague about it directly - she confirmed that there are still witnesses of our conversation in the salon. You should not treat people as if you are not equal if you are the owner or director.\nIf you are pregnant and you broke up with me because of hormones - I accept it, it is natural.
