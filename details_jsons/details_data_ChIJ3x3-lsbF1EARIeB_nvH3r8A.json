went to this coffee shop almost every day in the summer, until we started going with our children.

You want to drink delicious coffee, in the company of furry friends, to pleasant music, but... 5 little ones under 5 years old come in and start screaming, running, dragging those unfortunate cats. even when the cats have already crawled up to your arms, so as not to touch them, and children take those cats and start pulling them by the tail, preventing them from eating, sleeping, hitting them with toys. A very atmospheric, pleasant coffee shop has become a kindergarten \"without rules\", because the rules are just \"as if there were\". Parents with children, please teach children to behave with cats, that you cannot pull them by the tail, wake them up, shout in their ears, hit them on the head, etc.\nI was in a similar coffee shop in Lviv.
