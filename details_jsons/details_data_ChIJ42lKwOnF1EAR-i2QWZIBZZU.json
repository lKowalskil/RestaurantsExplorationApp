hostel is ideal for a maximum of one night.

My nails turned yellow for the first time in my life, and the white things I washed in this water also turned yellow, and even the brush for cleaning my face.

Everything is always on top. The most important thing for me is that I can be accommodated in this Guest House both at 5 in the morning (without extra charge) and at 2 in the morning. It's always cozy here, the staff are friendly and you feel like you're at home. In total, there are two bathrooms and one kitchen for five rooms. The kitchen is fully equipped to the smallest detail. Refrigerator, microwave, electric kettle, electric stove, as well as all the necessary dishes - all this is available for free use. That is, you can stay for one night or for several. Communicate with people who have been living there for 2 years. From this, we can immediately conclude that living in the Osokorka Guest House is quite comfortable. It is very important, if you are staying with children for several days, that you can prepare the usual food for yourself and the child. The house itself is quite cute. Always quiet, clean. The owners care about the beauty around. For example, this time from an ordinary alley, they made incredible beauty. From the repair of the road (although it is not theirs personally, there are still buildings along the street) to huge flower pots on the edge of the road, which looks very nice.\nUpon check-in, slippers, gel and soap are given for FREE! I have been to many places, so I have something to compare it with. The rooms are spacious. Each of them has a double bed. There are rooms with a terrace, some with a balcony. Some rooms have a TV. Always fresh bedding and towels. It's all very convenient, because you don't need to take all your luggage with you. There is a lovely courtyard where you can park your car, again FREE. The prices here are extremely low for so many services. Moreover, after the start of the war, they even decreased, and if you stay for more than 3 nights, there are discounts.\nI often travel on business and only stay here. I recommend Osokorka Guest House, you won't regret it.", "time": 1695089213, "translated": true}], "types": ["night_club", "bar", "lodging", "point_of_interest", "establishment"], "url": "https://maps.google.com/?cid=10765012212378512890", "user_ratings_total": 118, "utc_offset": 120, "vicinity": "192-a Sadova Street, 35, Kyiv", "website": "https://gostevoy-dom-osokorky.business.site/?utm_source=gmb&utm_medium=referral", "wheelchair_accessible_entrance": false}, "status": "OK"}
