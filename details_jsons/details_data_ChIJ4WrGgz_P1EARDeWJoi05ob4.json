The first week was trial and extremely unpromising (as I thought at that time), because I tried more than one food restriction in order to bring myself back to normal and, as a result, they were not particularly effective and not so beneficial for my body. But, gentlemen, I‚Äôll tell you, in the complex, as the guys from 2doeat say, training and such nutrition give results. Considering my work schedule, which does not include cooking food, and if it does, it is far from useful, this service provided me with the opportunity to turn from biomass into 123 kg. in 1.5 months into something with the outline of a person and weighing 110 kg. and this, as I see it, is just the beginning.\nAs for the point of view of this service, I will say that delivery is on time, there have never been any problems with this.\nThe diet is excellent, the food is varied and correctly selected to suit my requirements, taking into account the required amount of calories, which is an IMPORTANT factor for me, because previously I was very tired of sitting and independently calculating in grams how much is allowed and what is not allowed.\nWell, I‚Äôll say a few words about the packaging. Initially I was expecting a classic fast food ‚Äúfood wrap‚Äù. But no, that‚Äôs not the case, everything is packaged compactly and conveniently, nothing squishes when eaten and nothing overflows upon delivery. In general, the packaging here is far from standard table-type packaging, which also makes me happy as a consumer.\nOverall, I am very pleased with the service and advice, which turned out to be invaluable to me and has a result that I am now extremely pleased with. Of course, the guys have room to grow, so I wish them both ways - for them to grow, and for me to lose weight))) More rays of goodness to everyone))", "time": 1565209286, "translated": true}, {"author_name": "Ivan Malytskyi", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115343731607128849025/reviews", "language": "en-US", "original_language": "ru", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjX-T-8DzJbo-nGie9Eh1O550CGiJMXARevOE-F2trT7FzU=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo", "rating": 5, "relative_time_description": "4 years ago", "text": "You simply cannot find anything healthier and more nutritious!!
