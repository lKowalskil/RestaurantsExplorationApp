Portions are large, good prices. Delivery is not bad. That is, the chef of the restaurant takes his place. The waiter, a young man, served quite well in principle, recommended dishes, sometimes came to the table, was interested in which dishes he liked, which ones he didn't like, whether it was unnecessary to order something else. Unfortunately, there are more disadvantages. And, it is at the entrance to the establishment that there are many guests who smoke. A place for smoking should not be the center of attention, it immediately makes an unpleasant impression. This is a restaurant, not a bistro. That is, you need to allocate a separate place for smoking, but not at the entrance. Guests must be met by an administrator (whom I did not see during the whole evening) or at least a waiter. Very loud, sometimes it was impossible to even hear myself. A cleaning lady with a mop constantly migrated between the tables, this is not a dining room. It was possible to somehow beat this issue. But, this is a question for the administrator, who must organize and monitor the correct work of the staff. The lack of cashless payment was surprising, as they were not even warned about it. The wine list is poor, and the wine in a Georgian restaurant should not be Odessa.
