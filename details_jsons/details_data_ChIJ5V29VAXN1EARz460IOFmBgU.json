Both girl baristas - Svitlana and Lesya - are wonderful people, if possible, they will support you with a smile or simply do their work for you, Natalya, the owner, is very human and modern. For me, this small cafe is a certain symbol of advancement and European consciousness, it is inscribed in the space as aesthetically and carefully as possible with regard to the environment. It does not displace or violate the borders of others in the pursuit of its growth, but finds beautiful solutions. Trees are not cut down here, because we need a summer playground, but the Christmas tree is moved and taken care of. A pet- and eco-friendly small heroic establishment that brought joy and everyone held on with all their might in 2022, when there were few people.For this - special gratitude and wishes for further growth and prosperity.", "time": 1702206220, "translated": true}, {"author_name": "–Ü—Ä–∞ –¶—ñ—Å–∞—Ä", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104093465405640044378/reviews", "language": "en-US", "original_language": "ru", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjX9R6Am3majjyexsxROkwf2sNlQaH33whh99s17AwPJwqE=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba6", "rating": 5, "relative_time_description": "4 years ago", "text": "The interior is modern, the barista is friendly.
