design of this establishment is quite striking. Modern and sleek.\nThe menu has many options, from steak to seafood which is nice if you're coming with a large crowd.\n\nThe food is overall quite nice, the ingredients are fresh and you can tell they are trying. But the kitchen is slow, really slow, so you get frustrated waiting for your dishes to come. If you're really hungry and want a quick bite, maybe this place is not yet for you. There are still some issues to iron out. Growing pains, if you will.\n\nSteak was good but not the best sear, tartar was good but not quite enough salt. The staff is really trying, so 4 stars from me with place for improvement.\n\nEdit: After returning a second time, I can say that there have been significant improvements made. Most importantly, the wait time has been cut down. We were a group of five and did not have to wait for very long this time around. The staff and kitchen seem to be in better sync, which is great.\n\nGlad to see that the restaurant is working at getting better.", "time": 1635586308, "translated": false}, {"author_name": "Михаил Ш", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100639123347602032373/reviews", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjXRIFpUs-n5wr62X4Xqnei2bNU5tm8PRfOQ3m2y_afwKI4=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba4", "rating": 5, "relative_time_description": "2 years ago", "text": "Good service and welcoming atmosphere.
