It's the staff. Yes, the staff is really polite and knows their job, although there is no communication between the hall and kitchen staff (we attribute it to a recent discovery). Although having such a network it would be possible to bring internal communication to order.\n\nAnd now about the bad...\n\nThe hood is terrible, the hall is full of smoke, clothes are soaked with it.\n\nAnd it's not all bad...\nNow it will be terrible...\n\nFood....\n\nI have never had more terrible food in restaurants... There are nice photos of the dishes on the menu, but there is absolutely nothing in common with what is served to you, it looks very terrible (by the way, the low lighting in the halls is possible for this and is done so that you do not see that horror ).\nBy weight, you can even visually see that the dishes do not match the declared weight in the menu. They don't add food, or they will put the wrong thing, underestimating the cost (for example, a side dish where there should be arugula, instead of it they will stupidly put two untorn leaves of the cheapest lolo-biendo).\n\nFinally, about the main thing...\n\nThe wife ordered the medallions in Hamon...\nThe meat itself has a taste, but you have to know how to make fun of it. Medallions of beef tenderloin, almost everyone knows that by default it is fried to medium, but not here it is simply fried (killed) in a rubber sole (by the way, the waiter did not ask about roasting the meat).\n\nI ordered the Cherry Glazed Ribs…\nPeople, it was pi@ets... I have never eaten such a smelly meat dish. A piece of smelly fat with a small amount of meat on the bone. The appearance of the dish is more than terrible, the taste is even more so.\n\nResult...\nMy wife ate one medallion, I ate one small rib (well, I ate it 🤮), the rest went into a takeout box, to the dog on the street).\n\nYou will say that it was possible not to pay, it is possible, but I know how much work is invested in it. Therefore, it is better to pay and not go there again.\nI am attaching a photo as proof.", "time": 1705709674, "translated": true}, {"author_name": "Ірина Ломідзе", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107373041019085102538/reviews", "language": "en-US", "original_language": "uk", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjXwo6iLJmzNkh2WK6A1DeFwdf5F-nC62qFVNJhI37BUfw=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba4", "rating": 1, "relative_time_description": "a month ago", "text": "Not thrilled.
