I started with the hummus platter, which included hummus withe vegetables and chicken shaverma along with fresh pita bread. The hummus was smooth and creamy, with just the right amount of seasoning and olive oil. It was clear that the hummus was made fresh and from high-quality ingredients.\n\nFor my main course, I ordered the cauliflower, which is a traditional Israeli dish. The cauliflower at Shalom was cooked to perfection, with the sauce which tasted perfectly.\n\nOverall, the service was friendly and attentive, and the atmosphere was relaxed and inviting.
