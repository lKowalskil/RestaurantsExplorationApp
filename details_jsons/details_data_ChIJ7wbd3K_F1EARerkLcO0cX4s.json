Large territory.\n2. Friendly and helpful staff.\n3. Stylish children's rooms for holding a child's birthday. To be honest, I myself wouldn’t mind celebrating there in the Marvel room.

The staff is very careful about the order in the hall, so that all the cars are in their places, and if toys are scattered, they are collected and put in their places so that other children can play.\n7. Good trampolines, big labyrinth. Lots of interesting things.\n8. In the toilet, the children's pad is hidden under the adult one in a very thoughtful and convenient way.\n9. You can write a lot more about what we liked here)\n10. Regarding the kitchen:\nThere are waiters like in a cafe or restaurant.\nThey come up to you, you place an order, they bring everything to you.\nThen, like in any establishment, you will see the bill.\n11. The child was simply happy. We took the child away. We'll definitely come again\n\nOf the minuses:\n1. Alcohol is sold in the cafe on site. For me, this is not appropriate in a children's room.

She fell into a pit and hit herself very hard. 2 operations have already been performed, the child is currently bedridden for at least 2 months. A long rehabilitation and a third operation after 6-8 months are required.\nThe children's room is misleading when it says that it is an accident. There are witnesses, there is a video in which it can be seen that there is a blown hole.\nThey also write on my wife's review that they respond to similar cases. I want to announce that they reacted only on the 13th day of the incident. Our relatives came to them on the 6th day of the incident, but they did not react and did not contact us.
