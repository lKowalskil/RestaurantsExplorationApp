If you come with a child, unlike other establishments, you will not be offered a crib for the baby until you ask for it, and when it is brought, no one will wipe it. It is also your responsibility to see if the sushi sauce is on the table.\nIf you accidentally catch something on the table and your dish flies to the floor under your feet, then you have to clean it up. In our case, it was shrimp sauce. There was a hint of at least some acceptable level of service when we were told that it would be cleaned now. However, the sauce was only smeared with a thin layer under the chair. Since it was the only place to sit next to the child's chair, I washed the floor with wet wipes myself. After the waiter calmly asked if the sauce and shrimp would be included in the check, we had an unpleasant conversation with the manager. When the manager approached, she asked what the matter was, to which I told about the incident, how my husband spilled the sauce (although it was unnecessary, because she had already looked through the cameras). After interrupting me, the manager started a conversation from the position as if I refused to pay for the meal, and told me that she had looked at the cameras and there was no fault in them, so everything prepared would be in the check. I did not object. I just asked why the sauce was not properly cleaned, and I received an answer that the rules of the establishment are as follows: they are cleaned after the guests leave. I was surprised: this is your approach, right? The manager again began to say that it is not their fault and if I refuse to pay... here I stopped her and clarified that in the conversation with her I have never refused to pay, and I intend to do so, since I received an answer that it will be in check To which the manager responded that the dish would be removed from the check on the occasion of March 8.
