traveling around Ukraine for 2 months looking for a good steak house. I visited a steak house at Lviv which was rated very good but unfortunately I was disappointed that night but the waiter suggested that I visit Goodman when I was at Kiev. One day after dropping off my friend at the Kiev train station I noticed that the restaurant was not very far of a walk from the station so I decided to go. I am glad I did and had a very nice experience. The restaurant alone was beautifully decorated. The waitstaff were very courteous and helpful. There’s a nice variety on the menu. The wine was tasty. The chicken Cesar salad was good but I actually had better but this place is not a salad house it’s a steak house. The beef stroganoff and the Roquefort mashed potatoes were outstanding one of my favorite dishes I had during my visit to Ukraine.
