I have been a client of the OKKO network for over 10 years, but this is the first time this has happened. 11/16/2023 in order to refuel, drove to the 3rd column. At the time of entering the gas station, I had approximately 6-8 liters of fuel in the tank, the volume of the fuel tank is 47 liters. It just so happened that I usually fill up on 1 or 5 columns, and this one was probably my first time.\nAfter refueling, I received a check in which it was indicated that 47.5 liters had been filled! How can it be)? Then I went to the column and saw the same thing on the scoreboard. I asked the employee, but he said he didn't know anything.\nThe next day, I called the hotline in order to try to figure out how it could be that I was filled with more fuel than I could fit, or whether there was a mistake and, accordingly, to find a joint solution. I was informed that they accepted my application and that they would contact me by the end of the day. But no one contacted me on this day, nor on the following day. 20.11.2023 I called the hotline myself and reminded myself again - I was informed that they allegedly tried to contact me, but I refused calls(!)... In fact, nothing significant was said about the situation - as if you were fed up with so much of fuel (47.5) l, and take into account that you have a nozzle, which is also filled with fuel... Oh yes, I have a nozzle with a volume of 8 liters...!\nThe next day, their employee also called me (Oh, wonder - it turns out, as you have to ask, because of the quality of service, they call me like that)) and asked me if my problem was solved. I said no, and they told me that they would now switch to the responsible manager (and here according to the laws of the genre) - then I heard the switching signal and the buzzer cut off))).\n\nWhat actually happened. The automatic fueling column according to its mechanism - under air pressure, it pours fuel into the tank, i.e. air first flies into the tank with fuel, and then when the appropriate volume of fuel has been filled, the automatic fueling machine takes the air back from the tank. Should do so, but not this time! Accordingly, those extra liters are nothing but air that has not been taken.\n\nOKKO, for my mother-in-law, you bought me 5-7 liters of air, I will not apply to the commission for the protection of consumer rights, so that they remove your scalp - the darkness with the papers will take more time.\nAnd I advise all users to avoid column No. 3 until they calibrate and fix it.", "time": 1701096565, "translated": true}, {"author_name": "–ê–Ω—Ç–æ–Ω –ü–µ–¥—á–µ–Ω–∫–æ", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113367510970524156225/reviews", "language": "en-US", "original_language": "ru", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjXga0urCnDO9bCeeAXYzfO8_vZ0vasA8PKyaDApAH8924c=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba6", "rating": 5, "relative_time_description": "6 months ago", "text": "High quality fuel, tasty and familiar food, drinks, everything here is about the same as at other gas stations in the network.
