All the rolls are small, although the previous staff always made me larger rolls.\n\nOf the 6 rolls in the photo, only 2 red ones were fresh. All the other rolls, especially the maki rolls, are sour, and the green roll (my favorite is the Great Emperor) is generally old (I feel like someone didn‚Äôt finish it and they put it on me, because the whole bottom was in soy sauce and a few pieces of it The rolls were destroyed, as if they had been picked with chopsticks. The photo also shows that the top, which should be green, has dark spots (stale). There are hairs in the rollsü§¢\nI have always recommended and praised this establishment to everyone.
