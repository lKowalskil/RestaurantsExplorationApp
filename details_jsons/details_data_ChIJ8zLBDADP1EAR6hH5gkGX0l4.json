Pleasant interior in warm colors, excellent decor, furniture and dishes, the establishment is complemented by fresh flowers. They also took care of visitors: they have a separate stand with trempels where they need to hang outerwear.\n\nThere is not enough space in the coffee shop: three tables for up to 4 people, 4 separate seats near the window, and one place for an introvert. But despite this, the establishment is popular, and there are a lot of people here.\n\nThe kitchen is also very small and is located in the hall with visitors. It's interesting to watch how your dish is prepared.\n\nThere is only one toilet, but it is also pleasant to be in. Bright and spacious it has everything you need and more. Near the restroom there is a large mirror with a hand washbasin.\n\nThe menu is currently small. Much emphasis is placed on breakfasts and desserts. Breakfast can be ordered regardless of the hour of the day. Salad lovers will also have plenty to choose from.\n\nThe coffee is excellent! On the menu: 5 types of black coffee, as well as classic drinks with milk (latte, cappuccino, flatwhite). They offer both regular milk and alternative milk.\n\nThe kitchen is wonderful. The waiting time did not exceed half an hour. Coffee arrived after 7 minutes, pasta after 15.\n\nThe dish was served in beautiful dishes, smelled fragrant, and was very tasty. The pasta turned out to be not only beautiful and tasty, but also very filling.\n\nThe staff also keeps up the brand. I would especially like to note their tact. They will calmly wait until you decide on your order and will not push you with your choice. If you need help, they will be happy to advise you on all issues. Also share the secrets of where and how to take a beautiful photo.\n\nThe establishment is new, but has already won over many! Definitely recommend and will be back again for a cup of coffee and to try new dishes", "time": 1708209829, "translated": true}, {"author_name": "–û–ª—å–≥–∞ –ß–µ—Ä–∫–∞—Å—å–∫–∞", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103768339169023070800/reviews", "language": "en-US", "original_language": "uk", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjWWkzEe7ZeYs1E0IeqQUX8hCQFi2howwegTLoVUA42OjL8=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba4", "rating": 5, "relative_time_description": "3 weeks ago", "text": "Atmospheric cafe, with selected music in the background, delicious cuisine, incredible coffee and a charming interior!
