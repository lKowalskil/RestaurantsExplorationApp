The reservation went through without any problems, finding a hotel was not difficult, the price matched, a tourist tax was added to the cost (24 UAH per person). The administrator was polite, the room was spacious, comfortable, new equipment - TV, refrigerator, air conditioning, all furniture made of wood, its own bathroom with constant hot water, liquid soap and toilet paper. They gave 3 white towels for two. In a word, excellent conditions for low cost. There was a little dampness in the room, but tolerable. Also, as a bonus, there was parking outside the gate on the territory. But one thing killed us - it’s hard to call them a “cafe”. It's been a long time since I visited such a disgusting food place! Everything is old inside, unpleasant, there is a persistent smell of fried food. The staff in the cafe is simply no good, I would say “crappy”, the fork fell on the floor - no one was in a hurry to change it! The napkins also did not inspire cleanliness, not to mention the tablecloth! The prices are not low - well, ok, it’s the capital... But for that price we expected to get not only a hot, but also a delicious lunch in the cafe at the hotel where we live, which turned out to be just empty expectations! I would like to eat on the spot, but I had to order food for delivery. A huge shame on you for the food and such a disgusting place to eat! The cafe does not deserve even 1*!!
