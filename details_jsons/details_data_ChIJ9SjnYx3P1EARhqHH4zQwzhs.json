I had checked the menu before and this should have been approx 4-5000 for everything..... I challenged their bill, at which point i was physically thrown to the floor and dragged out by the security staff and kicked whilst on the ground, they stole all my money (around 10,000 Ukraine and 400 Euro), 2 credit Cards and my mobile phone!!!\nA lady who must have been associated with the club tried to negotiate and was being trying to be reasonable as she didn't want the police involved, but i just wanted the police. So I walked about 1 mile to my hotel to call the police. I am still waiting for the outcome. I'm sure the owner will pay the judge off but it will cost a lot more than they robbed from me\nI love Kiev and the people have been great, avoid this club unless you want to be assaulted and robbed!!\nJust spent 4 hours in Kiev Police station giving a statement, strange when my hotel called the club when i arrived back after the assault, the club said they were holding my belongings as ransom against the bill they alleged I owed, now when the police speak to the security chief...suddenly he knows nothing about my missing possessions.\nAvoid!

But I guess it is not so bad that they value their own personal happiness more than profit.\nWould you be any different if you ran a club full of music and girls?\nThe same group runs another club over near the Skybar shops as well.
