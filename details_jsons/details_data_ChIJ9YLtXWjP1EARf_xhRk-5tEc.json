We ordered it regardless but couldn’t finish it as it tasted more like a chopped up adana kebab served iskender style. Yoghurt it was served with was super watery and the bread underneath was far from fresh. Mind you this was the most expensive item on our bill.\n\nWe then ordered two servings of lahmacun and a pide with sucuk and kasar. It was downright amazing, the pide was thin and crispy with thick slices of juicy perfectly cooked sucuk. Lahmacun was also of the same quality, we really liked it.\n\nI then tried the pistachio kazandibi, it was also pretty good although it didn’t have the burnt end a traditional kazandibi would have.\n\nThe service, if you’re a non ukrainian/russian speaking foreigner is a bit bad. I’m sure ukrainian speakers have zero problems as it was obvious the waitresses were seemingly doing their best but couldn’t get past the language barrier.\n\nWe asked for lahmacun twice, the second time writing on the phone on google translate what we wanted, on both occasions they brought back drinks, the first one being some sort of orange juice cocktail and the second I think was just lemon juice, I’m not sure. Luckily there was a turkish speaking manager who came in and took our order.\n\nI also really wanted to drink some salgam but they didn’t have it which sucks as it seems like real salgam is almost impossible to get in kyiv if you don’t make it at home.", "time": 1687311253, "translated": false}, {"author_name": "Mustafa Dawood", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117424976151352915944/reviews", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjV5zOh_pc94Jr0Hzc5ZxPU33yYcsW5cvvegoNKIPjqIt3M=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba3", "rating": 5, "relative_time_description": "2 years ago", "text": "Friendly staff and tasty food.
