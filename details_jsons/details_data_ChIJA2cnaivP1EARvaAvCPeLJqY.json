But the story is not about that. The situation on February 14, I perfectly understand that the load has increased, I make an order 3 days before the specified time (I was influenced by the advertisement of the application). The damn application says that everything is being prepared, I arrive at the delivery point in 5 minutes, I check the status every minute, 15 minutes have passed and nothing has changed. I froze I go inside, and they tell me \"Did the contact center not call you?\". NO, I DID NOT CALL! (large print) And they inform me that my order will be in 1.5 hours somewhere. I think \"fuck it\" and neither sorry nor sorry, it's good that even though the look was sympathetic, I'm leaving.\nI'm sorry, but can it be issued on time to people who make an order in 3 days? What is this dummy in the application for? I'm sorry for that status when it is absolutely not relevant.\nAnd I'm not talking about the quality of the rolls themselves, it's certainly appropriate for the price (the fish is stretched into tasteless molecules, lack of ginger and wasabi). I'm talking about the crappy app and working with the client. And honestly, it doesn't matter that now someone from below can write back about how sorry they are. this situation did not happen for the first time, no one is working on this situation.\nYesterday's situation was a boiling point. I delete the application and promise myself that yesterday was the last time I stepped on this rake.\nOrder number and status on the box.
