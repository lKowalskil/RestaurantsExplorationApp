Thank you very much to the waiters, cooks and administrator - everything was on top.\nFor me, as a birthday girl, they made a 15% discount. And they also allowed us to bring our own cake and alcohol (the only condition was that the order had to be at least UAH 500 per person, but it suited us)!\nThank you very much again!!!

The problems started because of an inadequate courier from this establishment. First he called and arrogantly offered to meet him on the street, after my surprise as to what the matter was, he replied with a laugh that the text in the comment was too much for him and he did not want to read it and hung up. The second time he called and asked why the door does not open, he confused the 2nd with the 8th entrance and hung up again, the third time he called already at my entrance and complained that the numbers were not the same and were not pressed and again hung up the phone. To be honest, after such impudence and excessive nervousness, I didn't want to take the order at all, but I am a decent person and somehow it became uncomfortable in front of the restaurant, in front of the cook who prepared these dishes. After such an unpleasant incident, I immediately called the restaurant's administration, they apologized that this was unacceptable behavior and that this was not their courier at all, they don't have enough couriers, this is a freelancer, they promised me that he would not work for them again. The next day, they called again from this establishment, they said that they will not fire him, another courier will work for my delivery and, as compensation, they will give me khinkali as a gift for the next order. Of course, this does not suit me, I will never order from this establishment again. That is, let this complete inadequacy be rude to your next customers!? With all his demonstrative behavior, he showed that he did not want to do this work, that it was not an occupation for him. Now, during the full-scale war in Kyiv, there are many displaced people who are looking for work, who really can and want to work responsibly, and you, the restaurant, are holding on to this junk? Well, good luck!\nNow, as for the dishes themselves. The dishes you prepared do not look exactly like your photos on the website.\nRich beef broth Tatariahni:\nnot enough beef and greens, but you can eat.\nTsesaridze with chicken: you have a mix of salads written on your website, there was no mix! Only Beijing cabbage in large pieces. There was practically no parmesan, some crumb on the bottom of the package.\nNuts with condensed milk: they were kind of hard, no firmness in the structure of the dough.\nWith the first order, there was a gift: Chebureks with lamb. There was no cilantro, the lamb was too dry, no juiciness.\nWell, the \"icing on the cake\" is Ojakhuri with pork, there were no greens, as in your photo, but the worst part is over-fried meat, it's burnt!!\nIt was impossible to eat like that.\nThe only advantage is the price, but it is better to pay more in another establishment and enjoy really tasty and healthy food.\nTherefore, I do not recommend this restaurant.", "time": 1708496753, "translated": true}, {"author_name": "Tatiana Shabodazh", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114694250528002728761/reviews", "language": "en-US", "original_language": "uk", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjV6I-3xRyQwhotS5j5CRhA5Vt_gqy7-gG3exUruZRX6_IE=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo", "rating": 5, "relative_time_description": "3 months ago", "text": "Very cozy place, nice interior, dim light.
