has a very great location and I don't understand how it can be spoiled with such service. After a walk in the forest, my friend and I decided to go in and try the first course. Despite the fact that about 30% of the tables were occupied, we waited a long time for the waiter. They were all standing at the bar. They paid attention to us only when I started actively waving the menu. So, we ordered fish soup and green borscht. We were warned that we should wait 20 minutes. We were surprised that it was so long, but we thought, well, maybe they are so cool that they cook right away, instead of reheating. After 40 minutes, BARELY WARM meals were brought to us. When I asked why we waited 40 minutes and they couldn't even heat it up properly, they said that the kitchen was overloaded. But, I'm sorry, what? There are no people. We asked to heat up the dishes better, and to bring salt and pepper, and brown bread. It's been 20 minutes of waiting for bread. The dishes got cold again.\nBy the way, we also took the menu ourselves. The photo shows the number of people in the cafe, because of which we had to wait so long\nP.S.

The waiters are slovenly children dressed in dirty clothes and have no idea about their job. They don't know the menu. We asked for tea without jasmine - they brought it with jasmine. Hot dishes were served first, then salads were brought. I ordered a glass of lemonade and they brought me a liter.

And he is clearly far from the restaurant business if he does not see all this fierce trash happening around him.\nIn a word, this is the level of a cheap tavern, and not a restaurant, as this establishment unreasonably positions itself.\nWith this approach, this mischief will be covered very quickly.\nI came in a couple of weeks after the first impression - zero reaction.\nGuys, it shouldn’t be like this - garbage and washed dishes and unwashed dishes - all together!…", "time": 1630223335, "translated": true}], "serves_beer": true, "serves_wine": true, "takeout": true, "types": ["cafe", "point_of_interest", "food", "establishment"], "url": "https://maps.google.com/?cid=257706983124668474", "user_ratings_total": 239, "utc_offset": 120, "vicinity": "Kosenka Street, 110, Kyiv", "website": "https://www.instagram.com/forest.cafe.kyiv/"}, "status": "OK"}
