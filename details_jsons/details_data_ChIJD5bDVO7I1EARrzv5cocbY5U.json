The interior is not bad, the room is warm.\nNow about the situation. Entering the establishment, we asked if we could move the tables, to which we received the following answer: “You can, if you are not going to order one tea.” (so it’s rudeness, but I understood it, emotions, and yes, it’s infuriating when they take one tea and sit taking up all the space, but this, damn it, is our JOB, and what the staff wants there is not of interest to the guests! How sad and offensive , we benefited from this. Let's move on)\nThe waiter Alena came to serve us, the circumstances were such that I didn’t have cash, so it was I who asked to split the bill, because I wouldn’t be able to pay in cash, along with everyone else... (and I didn’t notice any ATMs nearby) that I received an answer something like: “I will count you out, as it is convenient for me.” (okay, this kind of bullshit happens, I didn’t pay much attention to this, because there is a terminal, it works, and the rest is a matter of technology..)\nThen everything was fine, they brought us food and drinks, we sat and asked for the bill. And they brought us a total bill. Alena brought it and ran away, I didn’t even have time to ask how I could pay by card, because let me remind you, I had 50 UAH in cash in my wallet...\nBut that’s okay, I went up to the bar, gave the bill with cash, and asked him to pay me with a card, I even counted my amount, the guy checked everything, and calmly paid me...\n\nAnd I wouldn’t even write a review, because I’m lazy and write reviews either when everything is very bad or when everything is very good. But. But our friend Julia wrote the review. And there was an unknown lady named Margarita... Who, apparently, is sure that insulting people for their impressions and feelings is the norm...\nAnd it was thanks to Margarita that I remembered this day, overcame my laziness, gave it 1* and wrote this text. And maybe I’m wrong, maybe Margarita doesn’t work in this establishment, but it’s a mystery to me why a stranger would leave a review for a review, and to be honest, once upon a time, when I was still starting my career, we ourselves they did that.\nI am attaching screenshots of the review, if you want to read it.
