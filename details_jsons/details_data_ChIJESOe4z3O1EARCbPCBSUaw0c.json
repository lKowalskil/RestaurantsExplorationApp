Not very known amongst tourists this is a true hidden gem. The local cuisine is fully represented. We had a few different Vareniki for starters. Kiev is lnown for its Salo, a kind of fat distantly resembling bacon, and this dish was a must-have on our table. A tranche of duck liver pate rounded off the starters. They have their own grill and make a fantastic shashlik and beef medaillons. The chicken Kiev is a true miracle! Chicken Kiev is a dish made from chicken minced meat, often styled in cordon-blue type fashion, stuffed with a Dill/Butter mixture. When cooled the mixture melts inside the meat and escapes to form a sauce once the meat is cut. Here they style the chicken to look like a chicken leg/ drumstick. They even add a little chicken bone to make it look like a real chicken leg. The spare ribs are good, but the sauce and flavor is not like the typical US Babyback ribs. A vodka room with over 80(!) individual vodkas is overwhelming and one might leave it to the staff to provide excellent suggestions. Contrary to what you might think, vodka is an excellent accompaniment to the food and does not need to be slammed down in a shot like manner. The restaurant offers a “vodka tree” with a selection of vodkas that can be shared with friends. Absolutely necessary to reserve in weekends.\nIf u dont know what to order, show them these pictures!", "time": 1643834994, "translated": false}, {"author_name": "Ben Hastings", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115776567624327857075/reviews", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjWE2J5WSVeVINKrkHMcsQHFKno6AG6OQtXNZNUFI-zqLFY=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba5", "rating": 5, "relative_time_description": "5 years ago", "text": "Fantastic, fine dining with Ukrainian cuisine.

I ordered a chicken and mushroom roll (similar to a blini) with a mushroom cream sauce. My friend ordered some form of potatoes pancake with Smetana. They literally were transported back to village life and were consuming Smetana by the spoonful!  I also ordered \"potatoes and bacon on the grill;\" I highly recommend. The presentation is wonderful but then it's just so delicious as well -- the potatoes were perfect and the cut of bacon was lovely. Order it was garlic sauce!  We also ordered blood sausages (not my choice) but I did try them. I don't love them because I didn't grow up with them but even then they were nice. I could tell they were very very well prepared. My friend loved them.  The restaurant also gave us a complimentary pickled vegetable bowl, which is a great experience for foreigners to see how everything can be picked here.\n\nThe wine selection was wonderful. Settled for a lovely rosé. The vodka room was impressive even to just walk past. And the bathrooms were in spotless condition. I can't recommend this place enough!!
