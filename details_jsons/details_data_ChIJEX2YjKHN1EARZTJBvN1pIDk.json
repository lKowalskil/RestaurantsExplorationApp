How can it be?\nI started arguing because the seller didn't tell me it was mine!! (but he redid it for me, for which, I thank him.)\nMake queue numbers and let people show that it is theirs, and not just come and take.\n\n1. There is no need to offer something to the cashiers so that I order. If I need it, I will order it myself. First, you must listen to Me, what I need.\nThe poor cashiers say the same thing to every customer, how do you think they'll feel after the day!?\n2. Put 2 people in the morning to cook, if necessary, 1 can't do it. As I saw it in the morning.\n3.
