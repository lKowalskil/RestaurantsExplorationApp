My pregnant wife and I went on a long journey from the suburbs straight to Blockbuster. It would have been weird to travel that far just for hot dogs... but that's how it was. Still, for entertainment, a movie was chosen to watch...the movie turned out to be so-so, not for everyone. But that’s not the point. How are things going at the establishment? But there was no way... it was not possible for us to find out. At first, we spent a long time looking for the entrance to this mecca of hot dogs and hamburgers. Soon, we got pretty tired of all this and we decided to call the number on the website... an employee of the establishment answered, told us how to get there and immediately asked if we had children. When he heard that we don’t have children, he immediately said - AND THEN YOU WILL NOT COME TO US!!! How do you even understand this? I’m interested to know where you could get information that the entrance ticket to your Blockbuster establishment is the presence of a child???\nYou may ask, why does my review have such a strange title - “Hidden extortion or business ideas shared?” ... so here is my answer - yes, all because the cashier at KIDLandia (the children's entertainment complex through which you can go to Mr.Grill HOTDOGS & BURGERS) told us that if we want to get there, we will have to pay for a visit to KIDLandia !!! Explain to me, is this how a meeting of guests should be organized? What's next? Will you need to pay for the services of a cosmetologist? Dry cleaners? Perhaps you will need to pay for your order on credit and only in parts so that the interest accrues? Come to your senses!!! If you have 2 establishments, one of which has such a reputation, then the first one will simply suffocate... and you will become another example of how an excellent franchise merged when it came to Ukraine.\n\nRESULT:\nWasted time and money on a taxi, spoiled mood.
