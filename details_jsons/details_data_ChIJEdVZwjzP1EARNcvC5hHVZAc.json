good and authentic south Korean restaurant.

And all the items on the menu were true Korean dishes. But the bulgogi was super tasty and the meat was cooked perfectly and was high quality meat. The dak galbi was super tasty; a perfect blend of spicy and a little bit of tangy/sweetness to balance with out and the chicken quality was very good. Lastly, the sujebi was good as well although I wasn't too big of a fan of so much seafood in the soup, but it tasted good and the first time I had it.

With each main course they bring additional 6 small side dishes, and one of them was kimchi. The taste of the kimchi... It was super delicious. It is really spicy, your mouth will be on fire if you have a low treashold for spicy food, but it will be worth it cause it is that delicious. I loved all the 6 side dishes, they were all really tasty. The food we ordered was also spicy but it is also delicious. The meats were grilled perfectly. They don't serve Korean barbecue but they do it by themselves and then bring it to the table. We also ordered steamed buns. Like all the food they also served as big portions. It is not spicy but it is hot which is normal cause it is steamed. They serve variety of cocktails but they are strong.
