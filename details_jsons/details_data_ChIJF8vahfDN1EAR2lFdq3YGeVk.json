In addition, very strange areas, because we were 7 km from the facility.\nThe second surprise is the taste of the food. Absolutely no spices, and even banally no salt. But it was supposed to be Georgian cuisine, which is filled with incredible flavors of spices... we ordered broth with mini khinkali - received water with carrots and 5 large khinkali. Kharcho soup, absolutely no spices, water, rice and pieces of meat... shrimps in a creamy sauce, absolutely tasteless, the only thing that has taste in this dish is small tomatoes. And a chicken kebab with potatoes, dry and again without spices. The general impression is that we ordered diet food. Thank you for apparently being so health conscious...but this is not what we expected from Georgian cuisine.
