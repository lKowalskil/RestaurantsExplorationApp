I have to write a negative revieuw for such a cool place, yet the truth has to be shared. Me and a friend came for a drink. The place was almost empty and since we sat at the bar, the two people working were the only people to have a conversation with. They were very nice, even though communication was very limited in English. We ordered shots (after we had a cocktail) and offered the personal something too, they refused the shot since they said only to drink cocktails. We were happy to pay for those in stead, but if u get the bill and pay 3 to 4 time the price (400HRN) of a regular cockail, then u know u have been ripped of. We actually got confirmed of that later, when we had another drink at a bar in the same nabourhoud that was way better quality and on third the price (90HRN). Its a pitty to be treated like a money bag, when u even offer the personal to have something (which is mostly cinsidered like a tip-apreciation).", "time": 1631033338, "translated": false}, {"author_name": "Kay Kolesnyk", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111008249270121867731/reviews", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjXk1II65YfHeJRW0LVtcAvgmwhGs9gQ8uSiyLgYHRG7Ba4=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba4", "rating": 4, "relative_time_description": "3 years ago", "text": "An interesting and unique location but they struggle with timing.
