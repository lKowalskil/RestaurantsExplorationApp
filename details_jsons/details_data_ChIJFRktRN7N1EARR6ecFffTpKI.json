Essentially: the undoubted advantages are the opening hours, a wide range of goods and drinks, very nice furniture inside, the coffee is not bad, matcha too. Everything about desserts, especially the passion fruit cheesecake, is a definite “excellent”, the pastries are good.\nNow about the service: I visited this cafe-shop three times, met almost the same girls, and my impression was completely unpleasant. Despite the fact that there were 2 or 3 of them behind the counter, the service was slow and of poor quality. “Go to that checkout” “go to this line”, despite the fact that there are 3-4 buyers. With a completely empty store, I waited 15 minutes for the matcha. The face of some individual employees expresses extreme dissatisfaction with the arrival of customers. I’d like to highlight as a separate point that I still don’t understand why, with the beginning of quarantine, you can’t drink coffee inside, because all establishments operate on the principle of no restrictions with a vaccination certificate (perhaps the staff wasn’t in the mood to wash dishes that day or I disrupted communication with his arrival, perhaps, of course, the management made such a decision for some reason). To summarize, it can be noted that the store is good in general, like the entire chain, it is well located, since there is nothing similar in the immediate vicinity, absolutely everyone liked the desserts that I managed to try, but there is an urgent need to do some work with the staff, because that when you are welcome, you feel it, but when you sit with the feeling that you have arrived at the wrong time, it completely discourages you from coming again.", "time": 1636321509, "translated": true}], "types": ["grocery_or_supermarket", "cafe", "food", "point_of_interest", "store", "establishment"], "url": "https://maps.google.com/?cid=11719725188497844039", "user_ratings_total": 32, "utc_offset": 120, "vicinity": "Vidradnyi Avenue, 6/1, Kyiv", "website": "http://molokoferma.com.ua/"}, "status": "OK"}
