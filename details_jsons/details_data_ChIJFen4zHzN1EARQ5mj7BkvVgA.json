Secondly, grilled vegetables - they served scraps of skin from blue ones, roasted in the oven, they gave us a whole bag, no one ate it, they threw it all in the trash. Thirdly, they didn’t even bother to warm up the hot dishes; everything was cold. The salads were dressed with the cheapest mayonnaise that tasted like vinegar. And most importantly, half of the dishes were left on the tables, they didn’t give us even half of what was left, I thought I’d fill up two refrigerators - there was nothing to eat for breakfast, but they gave us three heads and a tail from the grilled fish.\nAdvice: if you have ordered or are going to order in this cafe, collect everything from the tables yourself.
