And now to food:\n\nAs far as I understand from answers of the owner the concept was to combine restaurants with the best food in one place. I’m not sure this worked: to combine trendy places - maybe yes, but that does not necessarily mean they have the best food.\n\nSome sushi rolls for example in the range of 500 UAH and it was ok\nChicken Kyiv around 140 though it was tasty.\nPasta around 200 and it was ok\n\nAlso got a dessert from Milkbar and it was a huge disappointment! I do understand the place is not directly responsible for the taste of food their vendors sell, but if you want only places with great food, what does this does do here?! And service was bad (though at this particular place)\n\nLack of toilets (please do not start to tell about the “state standards”) but they are clean with paper towels and this is good\nNo parking lot. There was a comment of an owner that it is being organized, but this is the matter -  normally we shall expect all the infrastructure to be launched simultaneously with the place. But of course, parking lot will not bring those profits, so let the guests with this pain of finding a spot.\nAlso smell: we spent there 3 hours I guess, on the second floor and my coat and scarf smell with food like I was at the kitchen.\n\nOkay, this place not a disaster - nice design, lively, nice people. But did it manage to bring all the best food in one place - no. Did it manage to deliver good price/quality - no.
