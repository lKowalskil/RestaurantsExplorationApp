This is not a simple shawarma, you won't be able to buy it from an Armenian woman at a kiosk. In my opinion, although the price is high, the taste is also appropriate - at a high level.\n\nYou can only compare this shawarma with lafa from the Shalom establishment, and there it costs 300-400 UAH (rounded up, I don't remember exactly).\n\nAll the other shawarmas I've tasted are street level, only Avi and Shalom rediscovered restaurant-level shawarma for me. The taste in both establishments is very mmmm.\n\nRegarding the waiting time: twice I ordered at the location itself, the wait was no longer than 15 minutes. Both times I arrived almost before the establishment closed in 20-15 minutes and the shawarmas were ready and tasty.\n\nI also ordered through Glovo, the delivery was unexpectedly fast, I expected it to take an hour, but it arrived in Podil in 30+ minutes.", "time": 1703983001, "translated": true}, {"author_name": "Дарья Кочуг", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110357736077883551139/reviews", "language": "en-US", "original_language": "uk", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjUVn8QoCcdrkRUKAiHqp60K5C2HWWGwVbEXbQ8R2H2YmHU=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo", "rating": 1, "relative_time_description": "4 months ago", "text": "In short: The food is DEFINITELY not worth the price.\nExpanded: we took the classic shawarma with Cheddar cheese, cost: UAH 230, taste: SLIGHTLY improved ordinary shawarma in a good lavash. Lavash is really top, there are no questions here. BUT Cheddar was not felt at all. The taste of the sauce is, of course, a little better than that of cheap shawarma, but it does not attract any uniqueness at all, it is more like standard sauces from a hypermarket. The meat is absolutely standard.\nYou can get it from competitors, even in the very center, for the same price (or cheaper), while it will be a cafe with service and the main shawarma will be tastier. (I am silent about shawarma in remote corners of the city).\n\nI don't know what ingredients were used there and what their price is, but based on the final taste, the highest price for it is 130, well 150 UAH NO MORE.
