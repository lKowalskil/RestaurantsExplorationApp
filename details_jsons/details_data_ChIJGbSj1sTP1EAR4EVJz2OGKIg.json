He said that espresso is no more than 2 minutes and everything is fine. I say that espresso lives from seconds 30. He said that this is a myth and nothing to worry about. But from my own experience, I say that the longer espresso stands, the less tasty it becomes. Thanks, the guy offered to rework. But I don't know if he overbeat the milk. I saw this for the first time and I was shocked. For such money, pour coffee that has been standing for who knows how long. Despite the fact that he himself said that I would not feel the difference in milk. Then the question is about coffee. What kind of coffee is this that I can't taste.\nDesserts looked so-so, felt a bit weathered, although I didn't taste, I can't say for sure, but the appearance is not attractive.\nTo be fair, the coffee was delicious, the drink itself so-so, because the milk was so-so whipped, maybe it just stood while the guy processed the espresso.\nBut the atmosphere is good and the seats are cool.
