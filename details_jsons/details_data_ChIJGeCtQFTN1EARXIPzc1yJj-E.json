I agreed to change it to a new one and bring it. Well ok, I say let's go. The driver brought, I gave them the set that was not eaten. I go into the house, open it, and everything is the same there))))))))) only instead of tuna, salmon, which should have been from the very beginning. But as we can see, they don't have unagi sauce and mayonnaise again))))))))) it's just tin. And there are a lot of paid bloggers in Instagram, with sets with sauces and everything is so beautiful. I will not order from here again and will not advise anyone. You pay for one thing, they bring another. Video and photo in the attachment, look at this beauty and compare how they are on Instagram.
