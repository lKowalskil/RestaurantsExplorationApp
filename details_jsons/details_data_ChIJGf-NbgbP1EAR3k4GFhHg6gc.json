The table was wonderful, the lighting was romantic, the atmosphere was well-visible, and the waiters rarely came into this area. The first order was accepted in just 10 minutes, the waiting time for drinks was about 15. I chose a firestarter cocktail - tasty, strong, spicy; it was more difficult for the guy to decide on a drink, since most of the whiskey options on the menu were not available, he ordered rum and it was very unpleasant that ice was added to it without warning. Then I ordered an Old Fashioned, I often order this cocktail and it was very far from the classics, cloyingly sweet, it was processed and it was still not tasty. We also ordered an assortment of meat delicacies - good ingredients, a decent portion. At the end of the performance, they asked for the bill, which they had been waiting for for 30 minutes!
