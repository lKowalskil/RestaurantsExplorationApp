The coffee (espresso) did not impress. Well, it's like that - to whom. I didn't take sweets with my coffee because we don't eat them, we didn't even touch the welcome sweets - because my wife and I prefer healthier delicacies. But the comments to the neighboring coffee shop were unpleasant! And we used to visit it regularly. And here there was a break for several months, and I think it has gotten worse? that's why we went to her next time - we made sure that the quality is preserved + they made it even more comfortable there - and we started going more regularly! And I have no desire to enter this one anymore! Although, in their other new point, which is on the way to the central entrance to the park \"Feofania\", I recently visited - a powerful repair - a toilet - a toilet!!! and the rafkava was quite well cooked! and made from pure vanilla! but the price is \"biting\"! I drink much better and 2 times cheaper near work at St. metro Beresteyska!!!!
