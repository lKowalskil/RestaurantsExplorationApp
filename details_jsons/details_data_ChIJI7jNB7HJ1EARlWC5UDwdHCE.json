visited this shawarma restaurant, and I want to share my impressions about the establishmentüòâ\nCleanliness: The first thing I noticed when I entered the shawarma restaurant was cleanliness. The room was tidy, the tables and chairs were clean, and there was no litter on the floor. It immediately made a positive impression on me.\n\nStaff: The two boys who were on duty today were very friendly and attentive. I was immediately greeted, offered to choose something from the menu and answered all my questions. The order was taken quickly and prepared without too much delay. And they supported the conversation perfectly üòå\n\nAtmosphere: It was pleasant and cozy in the institution. As soon as you enter the premises, you are greeted by the fragrant aroma of meat on coalsüòç\n\nThe taste of shawarma:\n\nThe meat in the shawarma was juicy and aromatic, the vegetables were fresh and crunchy, and the sauce was spicy and complemented the taste. Lavash was soft and fresh. Shawarma was simply incredibly tasty!\n\nOverall conclusion: I wholeheartedly recommend Kraken Shawarma to anyone who loves tasty and hearty food. Here you will find friendly staff, cozy atmosphere and incredibly tasty shawarma. There is another big plus - it is fresh lemonade or low-alcohol drinks that will complement the taste of shawarma to an even higher level ü§§ü•∞", "time": 1710417819, "translated": true}, {"author_name": "–Ñ–ª–∏–∑–∞–≤–µ—Ç–∞ –ü–∞–ª—ñ–π", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109555446897759206643/reviews", "language": "en-US", "original_language": "uk", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocKcbtTHIgy9TuUf3vX39KxSSwmdpla75VAUffr8C4i_=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo", "rating": 5, "relative_time_description": "a month ago", "text": "Very cool atmosphere, the design of the store is absolutely bombüòçüòçüòç the tastiest shawarma I've ever tasted", "time": 1707226886, "translated": true}, {"author_name": "–ê–ª–µ–∫—Å–∞–Ω–¥—Ä –õ–∏—Ç–≤–∏–Ω–µ–Ω–∫–æ", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111955160903702904106/reviews", "language": "en-US", "original_language": "uk", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocLQF7EO2e6qasjyPkv0Uywvnx3Y_xmfubjJUZMfUiTg=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo", "rating": 5, "relative_time_description": "a month ago", "text": "This establishment prepares incredibly tasty shawarma that will definitely satisfy your taste buds.
