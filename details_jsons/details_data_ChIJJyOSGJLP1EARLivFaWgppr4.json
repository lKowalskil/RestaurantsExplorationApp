The place is really warm and cozy and the personnel is super friendly, professional and makes you feel very welcomed. We've been given a table with the warn that we would have had just one hour available due to the obvious full booking considering the day,we thought it was more than understandable considering the situation and we agreed, a bit worried about the timings. Well, I can say that the order was super fast to arrive. I asked and, as professionals do, considering the day they've called extra cooks and kitchen personnel to avoid slowdowns. I believe this should be copied by many restaurants, even pricier ones, because we really received our order in 7-10 minutes with the restaurant full.\nWe've been greeted with a welcome limoncello and grissini that were really tasty, considering I'm Italian I might suggest to either buy it or make it with more alcohol though.\nI ordered a pizza and a pasta with truffle and porcini mushrooms, both amazing, the portion on the pasta should be bigger though, but in general it was ok, the quality of both the homemade pasta and the pizza was top notch, I just gave my advice to put the oregano inside the tomato sauce instead of on top and more salt in the pelati. Besides that i was surprised. I'm not in Italy after all.\nMy wife took gnocchi and we both enjoyed a nice Valpolicella and prosecco brought with the grissini at the beginning. The atmosphere was calm relaxed and cozy. Perfect for very age and every occasion, from birthdays to romantic evenings to work lunch with clients. The dessert was super good, cannoli from Sicily with ricotta were super nice, I would add pistachios, much more.\nCoffee was great.\nThe only thing I would say if I may consider it something \"to check and fix\" is the bathroom. The bathroom is clean and nice however the water doesn't have the mixer, is open or closed. If you leave it on for more then ten seconds the water goes to +60 degrees and you guarantee burn yourself. Maybe it was just that day, but yeah, looking quickly at the exposed tubes it seems like there was just the hot water coming with no mixer to regulate it for the client.
