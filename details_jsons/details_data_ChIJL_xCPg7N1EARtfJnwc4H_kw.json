I bought it today and it feels like there is only bread in the cutlets. I don't feel any meat in the cutlets, which is very strange for cutlets. There was bread in cutlets before, but not so much. This is not just my personal opinion, as my girlfriend said the same thing. Product quality has dropped. People who do not know how to do business always try to make products as cheap as possible, which consequently leads to the loss of customers in the long term. It is necessary not to deteriorate the product, but rather to improve it or at least maintain it at the proper level. There is another option that this is the initiative of the establishment’s workers, who themselves add a lot of bread in order to save meat and the owner did not put forward such a quality requirement. Also, the dough in dumplings is too thick, it needs to be cooked for a long time and as a result it becomes soft, but people have already written about this before and the problem has not been corrected. I hope that the owner will read this review and improve the quality of the product, although I highly doubt it, since the problem with the dumpling dough has not been fixed. I won't be purchasing any more items anytime soon, I'll try again later. Maybe the owner will do something to improve the quality, since the establishment itself is very useful for people who do not have time to cook. I advise you to periodically send people unfamiliar to the saleswomen to check the goods. I apologize for the bad rating. I am not interested in negative feedback and will gladly correct the rating/delete the review if the quality improves.
