It’s Sunday, it’s freezing cold, I take the girl and go. We arrive, walk in circles for half an hour and can’t do it. To understand where it is, no one answers calls, no one answers messages either on Instagram or on Facebook. They froze, got upset and left, I wrote a comment under the last post because it was really disappointing to travel from the other end of the city to be left with nothing like that.\nThe next day they answered me that it turned out they had a sanitary day, which they miraculously forgot to warn about, and offered a discount as an apology.\nA month later we decided to go for a walk, my girlfriend’s friend joined us and I offered to call a taxi straight to the cheesesteak and from there go to the landscape. We arrived, thank God it was open, but I looked, in reality, as was written above, the room is 2 by 2, there is nowhere to sit, I think, well, at least the discount makes me happy. But even here, not everything is so simple, the girl who was on shift was terribly scared by the word “promotional code” and said that she needed to find out if it was possible to do this. In 15 minutes she still couldn’t get through to anyone and I screwed up for the second time in front of the girl, and now also in front of her friend.\nTo be honest, it seems like the owner of the establishment just threw money into it, and he doesn’t really care what happens next.\nI do not recommend it in any way. The service is poor, there is no establishment like it, the prices are sky-high.
