not to complain, but with the hope that you will improve the service. Baristas seem to be well versed in coffee and can choose individually for everyone. Delicious desserts.\n\nBut the attitude and the service in particular is not too sincere and it feels like you don't care about the guests, you just do the necessary minimum. Points 1) I go to a coffee shop almost every day and there is no brewed filter on any day. Why do you have a filter machine and a filter in the menu if it is never there? It is usually brewed in coffee shops in advance, at least a couple of portions. When I asked to brew some filter in the morning (because you are usually in a hurry in the morning), I was answered \"well, you are the only one who orders a filter\" of course, thank you for offering an alternative to aeropress, v60, coldbrew (??? such an alternative when I ordered hot coffee) 2) respectively the time in the coffee shop takes from 10 to 25 minutes - there is a queue and since there is never a brewed filter, the preparation of alternatives takes quite a long time 3) a small thing, but we wanted to buy filter bags for home, they are not on sale, but we asked for one so that we could brew coffee in the morning home. the barista answered \"no, such a position is not on sale\" - it probably wouldn't have affected me if there was nothing to compare it with, because there was a similar situation in another establishment, and it was clear that the barista did not care about the guests - he explained exactly which filters we needed , they didn‚Äôt have exactly those, they told us where we could find the filters we needed, the barista got into our problem, thought about how we could help and even thought that the filters that they have can be folded in a certain way so that I can make myself a coffee, and just gave me 5 filters yes üòÖ and here it's just \"we don't have such a position\" 4) the establishment is pet friendly, but there was never water for dogs\n\nI don't understand, would you incur really big costs if you brewed the filter ahead of time? Or would they give that one filter pack?", "time": 1697471293, "translated": true}, {"author_name": "–ë–æ–≥–¥–∞–Ω –î—è—á–æ–∫", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105525647262966484117/reviews", "language": "en-US", "original_language": "uk", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjVJ3C2-Y_FkkcUp7M6uB74PQVUNe5rC58DUXGHY6Y5iSpU=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo", "rating": 5, "relative_time_description": "6 months ago", "text": "The coffee shop is great, the staff is great too, the coffee is top notch.
