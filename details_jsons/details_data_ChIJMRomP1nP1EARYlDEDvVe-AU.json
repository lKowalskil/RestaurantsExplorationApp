The cashier refused to sell the product at a discount, for the price indicated on the price tag, although she should have sold it according to the legislation of Ukraine. It seems that it is the buyer's fault that the product was missing, and the price tag did not correspond to the value of the product. In general, this gas station has a very low level of service.
