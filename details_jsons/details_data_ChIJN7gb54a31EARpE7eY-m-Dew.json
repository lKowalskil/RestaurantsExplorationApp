People climb into the pool without washing their feet with sand and dirt. And the most disgusting thing is that in this actually tiny basin, which is called a pool, THEY BATH THEIR DOGS!!! Which makes it an unsanitary place altogether.\nUnfortunately, we wanted to eat and risking our health ordered food. It's a defrost from ATB, I think; though, thank God, I didn't have the opportunity to taste it, but I think it's just like that. The order could not be eaten because it was disgusting.

Thanks for the ruined day off.\nThe body of water itself is a small puddle of green water overflowing with people‚Äîit's hard to call it a pond, but it's still a puddle.\nTo get to this place, you have to overcome two obstacles - the first is narrow country roads, the second is crowds of blue rural marginals in a state of strong alcohol intoxication üòµ, very marginal appearance and the same behavior, not understanding where they are, they just rush under the wheels.\nAbove the puddle there was a strong smell of alcohol, and this, considering that it is in the open air, is still a pond.
