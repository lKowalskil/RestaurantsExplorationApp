The order was made by the very first. I ordered a dish that does not require cooking, namely dumplings. Sat down at the table. The table was dirty, everyone saw it, but no one even thought to wipe it. About fifteen people ordered dinner after me. The cafe worker brought utensils, while she was putting them, a knife fell on one of the visitors, containers with salt and pepper simply fell out of her hands. But they did not open successfully. I waited an hour for the order. Everyone who ordered after me had already eaten and left. A cafe worker came up and asked who didn't get the order, to which I said, \"What's mine?\" Another 20 minutes passed, no change. Cafe workers looked into the hall but did not enter, dirty dishes were not cleaned. Everyone who has already eaten left dirty dishes on the tables, no one even thought to clean them, it turns out to be the norm in this cafe. I came to find out why I can't wait for the order for two hours, to which I was told that everything is fine, but the dumplings need to be cooked. The kitchen asked whether the dumplings should be cooked or not, to which the cafe worker replied that it was not necessary, threw me money for the order and said that I could go home from the cafe and eat there. Because I spoiled their mood. Upon my request to provide me with a book of complaints, they replied with a smile that they have an electronic one. Unfortunately, he did not wait for the apology. Left the institution. I would like to note that in this cafe there is a constant confusion with the dishes, at the slightest remark only rudeness and rudeness can be heard.
