However, I always came across the seller's girlfriend. She was very pleasant, and understood over tea) then she boldly recommended this shop to all her friends. Today I stopped by for tea, the guy is working. I understand everything, it's summer, you want to go for a walk and swim, but you're working. But Christmas trees are sticks. Maybe he is brand new and doesn't know much about the range yet, because he wasn't looking for the ordered tea where it is 🙃. The problem arose when ordering a matcha latte. I asked if there was a choice of milk, and they told me that there was coconut milk, and also some lactose-free milk. I didn't understand what this \"another\" was and decided to let it be coconut. The guy started preparing the drink. I looked at the teas and dishes in the window. The match is ready, I reckon. I remember about the milk, I ask what it was made with, the answer is the usual... But I didn't ask ʼfor a jokeʼ about other milk. I have lactose intolerance. I say that I asked for alternatives, to which I received the answer \"well, I told you what there are, you didn't say which one you want.\" I don't know how to argue with people and I don't want to waste energy on arguments, so I took the drink and threw it out on the street (remember, lactose intolerance). It's a shame about the money, the drink I didn't drink and the fact that now I will only buy there if that girl is still working there. An unpleasant experience. Tell the guy about customer focus. Although, perhaps the company's policy has changed. When asked for an alternative to milk, one should understand that it is not just a question out of curiosity, and ask the client again - which milk do you want/which one was chosen. In my experience, people who order matcha do not drink cow's milk, even lactose-free. I'm sure there are some, but the majority (from my environment) use plant-based milk. In other establishments, they always ask 🤷‍♀️ I can see how a customer in a restaurant asks \"can the dish be made without nuts\" and the waiter answers that yes, it is possible. And he brings a dish with nuts, because the customer did not say that he did not have nuts, but only asked 🤦‍♀️\nIn general, if you want lactose-free or vegetable milk, say it loud and clear right away) then it should probably turn out the way you want)\nTg with mallow - top, as always) my summer love 🥰 I’m already making a cold version of tgshka) it will probably overcome the negativity)", "time": 1688301483, "translated": true}, {"author_name": "Тетяна Пальчевська", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113627604880104474065/reviews", "language": "en-US", "original_language": "ru", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjUSH8jU7ZpAXzS1KcrWufeoEb24pKd2INYW5mh7FK3VJpA=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba4", "rating": 5, "relative_time_description": "2 years ago", "text": "Cozy place, delicious coffee, helpful staff.
