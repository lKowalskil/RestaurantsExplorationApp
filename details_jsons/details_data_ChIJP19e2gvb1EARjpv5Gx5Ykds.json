I don't want to repeat myself so in short terms - terrible experience at this place. The food was bad - not fresh, oversalted and fatty but the service was even worse.\n\nUPDATE: are you freaking kidding me?! Instead of apologizing for my horrible experience in this place the restaurant called me a liar in their reply. That's the rudeness and arrogance in some Ukrainian hospitality business that I will never get used to... So now I'm going to go into MANY details to tell you exactly WHY this place was so awful.\n\nWe came for lunch on a Monday, June 10th 2019. There were 3 of us, 1 was a foreigner who we wanted to treat to a true Ukrainian lunch on our way to the beach, that was why we picked this place - Ukrainian food. It was a horrible experience. The pickled herring was frozen inside and tasted old and stale. The server was never around (although there were only 2 tables occupied on the terrace) Also she mixed up our order and then tried to persuade us that it was exactly what we ordered (3 people remembered it wrong, according to her). After she realized it wouldn't work she was just standing there, looking exasperated, not trying to take the wrong dish we didn't order back or fix the mixup in any way. My foreigner friend eventually just felt sorry for her and said she'd eat the wrong dish. But she is a healthy eater and what was brought to her was so oversalted, oily and fatty that she couldn't even finish it, despite being very hungry.\nI was ashamed for my country's restaurants after this lunch, both about food and service. I will never come here again, or recommend it to anyone who expects good food or quality service.", "time": 1565105288, "translated": false}], "serves_beer": true, "serves_breakfast": true, "serves_dinner": true, "serves_lunch": true, "serves_wine": true, "takeout": true, "types": ["restaurant", "point_of_interest", "food", "establishment"], "url": "https://maps.google.com/?cid=15821523852270869390", "user_ratings_total": 336, "utc_offset": 120, "vicinity": "Hydropark, Brovarskyi Avenue, 7а, Kyiv", "wheelchair_accessible_entrance": false}, "status": "OK"}
