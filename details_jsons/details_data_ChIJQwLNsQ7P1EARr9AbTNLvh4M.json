this club, I read in detail about the reviews and decided to drop in. My experience in brief:\n1. Of course, one should be aware of the fact that there is an entry fee and also you simply cannot order a Pepsi and stay there for 2 hours. You need to order as you are enjoying the show.\n2. I was there for 5 hours and during my stay not even a single performer bothered me / asked me for extra service / disturbed me for money etc., etc. They accepted money only from those who wanted to reward the performers.\n3. Finally, I spoke to one lady and I was genuinely overwhelmed by her nice, polite and humble behavior. In my personal opinion, after a point in time, good manners and behavior are also equally important.\n4.

Just a beautiful show in a good atmosphere and no scamming . I definitely recommend to visit this place and enjoy the moment.

The service of girls are nice, not only dance but also their attitude.\n\nOnly one problem is the dancing room, which is too dark!!!!

Reserving a table seems to the only way to get a good seat and see all the best action. Dancing (and it is real skilled dancing) on the poles is interspersed by erotic shows and some of these are amazing. The girls are all beautiful in their own way and there will be a lady for every taste in the female form\n\nAfter multiple visits when in Kiev, I can now say that Princess Club finally gets a well deserved 5 stars. I now understand how it operates and like their approach. The customer is king! Everything you want and hope for from a club in Kiev is available, just a little more discretely offered.. As always and rightly so, the more respect you show a lady the more she will relax with you. Saturday night was one of the best I have experienced from Kiev nightlife.\n\nThe club is very well managed and service is quick and professional. The lovely waitresses are constantly looking to see if you need anything but do not intrude. Security is not intimidating. The layout is good and not claustrophobic like smaller clubs and girls rotate round a series of stages so nothing is missed. The music is also recogniseable and enjoyable for my generation, and there was also a live singer on occasion. Drinks can be a little expensive but just be cautious and just choose wisely.", "time": 1581245541, "translated": false}], "types": ["night_club", "bar", "point_of_interest", "establishment"], "url": "https://maps.google.com/?cid=9477807627323560111", "user_ratings_total": 180, "utc_offset": 120, "vicinity": "Khreschatyk Street, 14, Kyiv", "website": "https://princessclub.kiev.ua/"}, "status": "OK"}
