The food is delicious. However if your a foreigner you will be rob. They add a tip (fraud) and do not tell you. This location charge me almost 13% and since I paid with cash. They also stole 64UAH The bill was 934. I gave the waitress 1500UAH asking for change. She only returned 500(200x2 +100). She kept the 64 from the 1000. Never did waitress or manager tell me tip was already charged they stole 64UAH from the 1000 UAH. I still gave a 400 tip making excuses that it may be cultural.\n\nAs a New Yorker, I shouldn't had let my guards down but seriously. As an Americans visiting Ukraine during the war to stimulate the local economy, our POTUS Biden and U.S. Congress have directed more than $75 Billion USD in assistance to Ukraine, which includes humanitarian, financial, and military support, according to the Kiel Institute for the World Economy, a German research institute.\n\nI returned to the restaurant today bec I love Napoleon and Filet Mignon. This time I counted my items and use calculator to tally the total and noticed two aditional items, to which I question. Then they explain that tip was already added even though ticket states in English \"SERVICE NOT INCLUDED.\" All other items are in Ukranian including the tip. I was charged  323UAH for just one person. I also had Tobadco hot sauce and even that was also charge but after going to another restaurant the day after and noticing they also charge for sauce.\n\nIf your American or a foreighner double, triple check your bill. The food is delicious but not worth it because you will be charge a tip automatically. There is no reason for server to be attentive to you. The restaurant is popular with the locals and rightly so, the food is delicious but foreigners be warned. They do not respect you, they will rob you. I spend 3549 UAH. There was no reason to steal from me and even charge a tip of 323UAH for one person.
