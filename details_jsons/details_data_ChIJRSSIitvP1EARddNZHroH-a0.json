The foam has no taste, the coffee is cheap, it feels like the machine is not cleaned, or the beans are over-roasted. As a buyer, I am not interested, there is no taste.\nSandwiches, it's generally bad. First, you are not invited to heat them on the grill, because they do not have one. Offer to warm up in the oven. It is bad from it, the leaf will shrivel, the cheese will not separate.\nThe sandwich itself costs UAH 100, approximately, maybe it's raining, we took 2 + 2 coffees (300 UAH all together), we didn't look at the price, the sandwich is bad! Really, it's bad, all the ingredients are cheap, the sauce is sour, there is not enough meat, the bread is stale, the cheese is the cheapest in the world...\nIn short, I do not recommend! In general!\nWe live across the street in a new house, have been there several times, always bad. Therefore, this is a practice, and not an isolated case\nBy the way, they didn't offer you syrups in the bumblebee either, because there isn't any. For UAH 90, drink cheap juice with coffee.\nI can only praise the friendliness of the barista and the confectioner who is brought. The cheesecake is worth the money.\nAnd now the most interesting thing is that a coffee shop appeared on Google not so long ago. As soon as the sandwiches appeared, we stopped by for a novelty, because, I repeat, we live nearby. At that moment, we came across a missing sandwich, about which I wrote to the company's Instagram, but they do not respond, comments are closed. That is, there is no feedback. It is not pleasant for this state of affairs, because the coffee shop on contract has a much better taste of coffee.\nI very rarely write comments on Google, but it was not pleasant here, because before when I was on a contract, I always ran into this coffee shop.\nP.S. The house is opposite, let me clarify, 044zhk! If you are the owner, maybe you need to stop by the points and check?! Do you know that there is a new house at 37 Kyrylivska, which has existed for more than 2 years? I am registered on Google, write to the mail. I do not want to denigrate you!
