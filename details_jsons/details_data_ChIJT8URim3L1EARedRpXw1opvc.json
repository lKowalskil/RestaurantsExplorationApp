We will not go there or to any of their institutions again!!!!\nP.S. be prepared that even if you don't take it home, you will have to disassemble and throw it away yourself (but don't worry, they will give you a knife to shovel all the balls and a broom to clean up all that and the monsoon bag, I was very happy while I was cleaning the hall))) this is probably in the amount for the service was not included)", "time": 1699438404, "translated": true}, {"author_name": "Dempinox Group", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102402653599396990828/reviews", "language": "en-US", "original_language": "ru", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjVqcnehAC34ok-sCxxb7ciEe7aC-nKWt8UiXFIfO5l-CQ=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo", "rating": 1, "relative_time_description": "2 years ago", "text": "The worst restaurant I've visited in a long time.

Article 182 of the Code of Ukraine on Administrative Offenses stipulates the maximum penalty for violation of the provisions of this Law - confiscation of musical equipment (for repeated offenses).\n\nA request to the restaurant owners. Consider that people in their own apartments need to rest, not listen to your loud music. Especially on weekends and in the evening and at night.
