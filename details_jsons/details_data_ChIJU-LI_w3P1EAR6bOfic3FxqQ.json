It spoils the impression very much if you have to get up, look for the waiter (who is watching TV with the bartender) and ask for napkins and spices, in my opinion, this is an elementary thing! The table is set before the dishes are served!\nWe ordered pancakes with chicken and cheese, asked for sour cream separately, they said that there was mayonnaise, they refused sour cream, in the end, if there was mayonnaise, it was somewhere deep in the filling, they didn’t bring sour cream but included it in the bill! The julienne was a bit dry, as you couldn’t taste the Bechamel sauce at all.\nWe ordered wine, according to the menu 100 grams, they brought 150, when asked why, the waiter replied that this was how they served it, but they didn’t have time to change the menu, when asked why the waiter didn’t warn about this, the answer was “I don’t know.” In addition to the missing sour cream, a 10% service charge was included in the bill; the question immediately arose for what?\nI think that these are mistakes, first of all, of the administration! And they understand this, because after presenting justified claims, they silently handed over a new bill :) neither the administrator nor the waiter came into sight again, although the administrator was the first to come up and smooth out the whole situation !Probably it was possible not to pay and just leave, since we were sitting on the summer terrace.\nAs I understand it, the establishment exists only through business lunches, so they don’t care about the service.", "time": 1532450646, "translated": true}, {"author_name": "War Kuzmich", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105771857444859340253/reviews", "language": "en-US", "original_language": "ru", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocIlj1YXoUZu4MTpIAvgOeWqVMQ6YuQaUk4AZjxJcZnj=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba2", "rating": 3, "relative_time_description": "5 years ago", "text": "The interior is good!
