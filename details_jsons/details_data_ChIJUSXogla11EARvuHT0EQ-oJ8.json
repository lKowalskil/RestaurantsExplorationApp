So next time I will take a screenshot with it! Yesterday I wrote this:\nThis was my worst experience ordering sushi in my entire life. There is something to complain about, despite the fact that I can close my eyes to a lot.\n1. This is, of course, service. I waited 25 minutes for my order of 2 unfortunate sets with Philadelphia eel, even though the girl had previously said that the wait was only 10 minutes.\n2. Beer. The light beer was sour, which clearly hints at its staleness. Almost no gas, with sour foam and midges in it.\n3. Midges that made it difficult to eat and “enjoy” the atmosphere, if you could call it that.\n4. I ordered 2 sets of “Philodelphia”, but they brought 2 sets of “California”. To which I also closed my eyes. (The eel should be on top)\n5. (I attached the photo, I apologize for looking so ugly). There was no eel inside the rolls, can you imagine? In the photo you can see what was carefully removed from the inside with chopsticks after one portion was eaten. Instead of an eel, there was a skin inside that was not chewable.\n6. Sushi. They were icy. Some of them crunched from the inside, and it was not a cucumber, but ice, which is why I conclude that the guys took them out of the refrigerator and waited until they warmed up at least a little.\n7. Sauce. It stretched stickily all over the plate and tasted sour.\n8. 10% goes to the check. Special thanks for this - 2 glasses of beer, two sushi sets with something unknown cost me 700 hryvnia and half an hour of waiting.\n9. Not sure if all employees have licenses. The guy who “cooks” the fish does it with gloves, just as he uses them to wipe the sweat from his forehead and pick his nose.\n\nI do not recommend this establishment unless you want to go to the hospital with severe poisoning.

They brought it after a reminder, after 2:20, with a discount (from UAH 450 to about UAH 380).\nI was hoping that was the only slip up. When you want to eat like a wild dog, you cherish the hope that the wait was worth something (no).\nExperience has already forced me to buy a kitchen scale, so I weighed everything right away - they didn't add a little bit everywhere. The food looks normal, but it's cold, just room temperature. Most likely, they made the khavvik a long time ago, they just forgot to bring it, because it takes 10 minutes to walk from the restaurant to the place of delivery.\nAfter unboxing, my snowball of disappointment continued to grow in diameter as the fries were already dead, cold and plastic. Impression, as if I brought malnutrition from the poppy at night, and, being hungry in the morning, decided to eat.\nThe burger is almost okay, the bun is dry (no, not fried), it's hard to distinguish the taste when you eat it cold, but I chowed down because I've been waiting for the delivery for a long time.\nAccording to the menu, the burger with potatoes should have weighed 450 g, but everything in the pile weighs 419, for such a complex dish, the weight is usually written through a dash, for example: 250/75/50.\nIn Philadelphia, a good piece of salmon, but it has an earthy aftertaste, that is, not fresh, again underweight. Out of fear, three sets of devices were thrown instead of one.\nConclusion: it is impossible to do worse - they were late, they brought cold, not fresh, they were undervalued.\n**\nTo the answer.
