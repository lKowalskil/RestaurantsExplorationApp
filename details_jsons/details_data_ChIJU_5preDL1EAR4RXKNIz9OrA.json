Potatoes were stolen - a small handful. The evening was ruined, as was the dinner.\nTime has passed, I think I will give it a second chance.\nI order a cheburek, at a cost of 100 hryvnias, it is completely empty. I am attaching a photo. At the end of the cheburek, there was about 1 teaspoon of meat, this is for the entire cheburek, or rather, for the cheburek dough.\nYour interior is very nice, but people go there to eat, not to admire the interior decoration. It is very noisy in the hall because of the hood, how do those people work in such a noisy environment, it is impossible to sit in the hall because of it, and how to work a shift until night.\nI advise the manager of the establishment (if there is one) to taste the dishes that are served to people! Are they edible, and what is the quality. Prices are too high!\nAlso, your hood stinks with old oil all over the street - you can't pass by now, you have to go around on the road.\nAdded by me after the manager's \"answer\": Why talk about my honesty several times? I don't understand what honesty is all about here. Because even from the photo you can see the quality of the product!!! No one is obliged to return low-quality products to you, instead YOU are obliged to prepare and sell quality products!!! Imagine! And, by the way, I see almost the next day after my review, you specially prepared and took a photo of cheburek with a visually visible filling.
