And when another point opened near the house, it only made me happy.\nBut after three unsuccessful attempts to try almond cocoa from the winter menu, the impression of the chain soured\n\nAttempt No. 1\nThe first time I was unlucky, and in fact, then for the first time in my life I saw an employee sleeping at work. Well, it’s a sin to wake a person, so I went on my way\n\nAttempt No. 2\nThis time was also unsuccessful. I stood there for about three minutes, looking straight at the guy for whom the phone turned out to be more important than work. Since it’s so important, I won’t jump, wave and try to signal, I won’t distract from the important matter\n\nAttempt No. 3\nThis time there was a girl and for the first time it came to service. I clearly say “Please, almond cocoa,” taking out the card in advance. The girl said there is no almond milk, only soy milk. Well, I haven’t tried the winter menu before, I was just planning to, so I didn’t know the composition and whether it could be made with soy milk. But let me clarify: “Is the price the same?” They answer me positively, and I nod approvingly. Seeing the card, the girl asks about the payment method and hands over the terminal. The calculation was successful, the receipt is printed, and she gets to work. And while she is fulfilling my order, I look at the receipt for fun. And instead of the expected 49 UAH, all 70 are waiting for me. I immediately understand that something is wrong here. From my angle, the price was not visible on the terminal, there were no clarifications, so I immediately told the girl that the calculation was wrong. She apologizes, removes the already prepared order and prepares what is needed, but in the process it turns out that the cream has run out. I ask her, how are we going to solve the situation? After all, the money has already been written off.\nAnd of course the story ended with a refund in cash, but it’s still unpleasant.\n\nAnd so, after three attempts, I failed to try the new Aroma Kava product.
