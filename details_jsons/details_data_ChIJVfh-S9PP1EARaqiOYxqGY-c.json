I was told that there will be a lower hall and there will be karaoke. I asked if there was a place upstairs when booking a table, I was told no. Well, I wanted to come, so I came today (I reserved a table for three), the lower hall.\nThey came We waited for 20 minutes for someone to come. Waiter Olya (in black, not in uniform, like all waiters). I was asked in whose name (Ruslan or my name) the table was reserved and whether it was reserved 🙈 The order was made, the waiter wrote everything down in a notebook and left. As a result, we waited for that order for an hour!!! And no one came forward to say anything when the order would be even partially. But even drinks... I had to run and catch. That is, it is realistic to go after the waiter and have time to ask before she ran away. Drinks stood at the point where orders are entered into the computer ready to be served for 20 minutes, and after questioning and tugging at the waiter, they finally brought it to the table. Pepsi is already warm in a glass in bottles ((The order included 2 salads, sliced ​​meat, baklava, cappuccino, 3 Pepsi, fries and 15 nuts with it.\nAs a result, one salad was simply forgotten, when it became clear, I told them not to do it. The fries were overcooked and barely warm when they arrived on the table, they probably forgot to salt them.\nCappuccino was brought, it had already cooled before they brought (again after my questions to the waiter and waiting for half an hour!!!) baklava. Cappuccino was replaced with a warm one.\nThe music and karaoke are loud and I had to shout to be heard at the table.\nThe distance between the tables is less than in McDonald's. It is very uncomfortable when someone is too close to my table, food, communication at my table.\n5 peanuts turned out to be...\nWhat was the point of writing in a notebook then if you forgot about the salad and did not hear about the amount of dessert? Why am I, as a client, just left to wait for an unknown amount of time without any information?\nPeople came to the next table, they immediately took their orders and after 15 minutes they had both food and drinks on the table. What is this relationship? Why do I have to watch someone eat while I'm being served and ignored?!\nSadly. Upstairs there was a free table all this time!((((\nVery long, left after 2 hours. I have a spoiled evening and holiday mood. Because of this service. Zero communication from staff to guest. Instead of the festive mood and atmosphere, I have to run and catch the waiter, who has been bringing me drinks for an hour and says \"right now, I'll check\" and comes half an hour later. I just wanted to get up, leave and not come back.\nIt's a shame about the time and that the evening is ruined, I would rather book a table elsewhere.", "time": 1709928162, "translated": true}, {"author_name": "Вікторія", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114245952119694531612/reviews", "language": "en-US", "original_language": "uk", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjVyuG9Ebe3a7ejF1ngoC3DhDLSD6ZPTCxj0ejxkrpsKpXW2=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba2", "rating": 5, "relative_time_description": "a month ago", "text": "Congratulations!\nWe visited this restaurant yesterday, everything was great!
