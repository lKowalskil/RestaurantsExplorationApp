People, I’ll tell you honestly, I took a chance and ordered six and a half hologram kebab. Grilled vegetables and potatoes. The office was covered. They divided it into portions at my request. It's -2 outside, there's knee-deep snow, it's winter all around, there's no smell of spring!!! And we cover the grilled vegetables with shish kebab!!! And how delicious everything is, the kebab is soft and hot, the grilled vegetables are something!!! You can't imagine how excited the girls were!!! Everything is perfect and right on time.
