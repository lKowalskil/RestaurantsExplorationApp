The taste is not very good, the dough is fresh.\n\nAfter leaving a bad review, they called the next day, apologized, offered a gift pizza, and said that they would improve. Today, April 17, they brought the same large Hawaiian one, but I asked to add mushrooms - everything was as needed. This time it was delivered faster, the pizza was warm, sealed in foil to keep it from getting cold. It’s nice that there is a lot more filling, no empty spaces, a lot of cheese, more sauce. Already much better than last time. In terms of taste, I would say it’s still a 4 minus. But it is clear that the company is trying to improve and the opinions of customers are important to them.
