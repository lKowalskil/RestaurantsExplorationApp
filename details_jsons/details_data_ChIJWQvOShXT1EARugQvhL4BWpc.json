have been to this restaurant 1st of August , 2021.\nI was recommended to go this restaurant as it should be kids-friendly,  nice location and view.\nUnfortunately got the horrible experience that started with not gentle welcoming (I was 10 minutes late with kids). The baby-chair that was promised to us by administrator was broken. The new one arrived only when we where insistantly asking the personnel.  The service was poor. I was filling the glasses of my guests myself. And I was needed to search for our water somewhere every time we needed something . My 4-yearsold got a broken glass which was literature dangerous. The cherry in the top of my celebration was that the most of the guest had stomach disorders right after we had a dinner in this restaurant . I got a fever, was vomiting every 15 minutes and diarrhoea ofcourse.\nNever ever again!\nOh and a room for the kids. Was just a tiny warm room without the AC or opportunity to open the windows. A bit of toys that were mostly broken. A lot of someone's clothes all around. Messy. Dirty.\nI hope you, guys , will  change something in your attitude. It was a shame to spoil my birthday party  and moments with my family that I have not seen for a long time.", "time": 1627992035, "translated": false}, {"author_name": "Sossio Perrotta", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117704087459415929378/reviews", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocKMa_eHGeQALNrJPri_e4_apByd3GFN3Diu-B7lZg2Z=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo", "rating": 1, "relative_time_description": "2 years ago", "text": "Have ever booked a table at a restaurant???

We remembered the very soulful, atmospheric establishment Park Land. The doctor wrote the sex of the child on a piece of paper and folded it so that it would not be noticeable, we called the restaurant so that after dinner they would simply bring us a small dessert (blue or pink) (we brought them a piece of paper in advance), the restaurant administrator Lena said on the phone that there was no pastry chef, but she was extremely determined to help us, and was also very polite and pleasant. When we arrived for dinner, WE WERE SHOCKED!! The restaurant even ordered boxes of balloons for us. But the biggest sensation came after, when they brought us chocolate balls that needed to be broken and, in addition, they brought their signature Kiev cake, but they also decorated it. They made our holiday better than we planned ❤️❤️ in general, I can write for a long time, but I can say for sure, if you want incredible emotions on an important day for you or even on an ordinary day, then you should come to Park Land🫶", "time": 1697136387, "translated": true}], "serves_beer": true, "serves_breakfast": true, "serves_brunch": true, "serves_dinner": true, "serves_lunch": true, "serves_wine": true, "types": ["restaurant", "food", "point_of_interest", "establishment"], "url": "https://maps.google.com/?cid=10906031365404165306", "user_ratings_total": 266, "utc_offset": 120, "vicinity": "Obolonskyi Avenue, 2Т, Kyiv", "website": "https://www.parklandrest.kiev.ua/", "wheelchair_accessible_entrance": true}, "status": "OK"}
