The service has always been top notch, but there is one thing that was very disappointing. I came to the cafe with my sister. It's hellishly hot outside, we wanted to get lemonade, but there wasn't any. I took another drink, and my friend went to a nearby cafe for lemonade, because she doesn’t drink coffee or matcha, and there were no other options. When my sister returned, we sat at the table for 5 minutes, after which the waiter came up and said one phrase, “Sorry, we can’t bring our own.” The sister was forced to simply get up and leave. Guys, I understand everything, you have rules and that’s ok, but given that we initially wanted to take lemonade from you, but you don’t have it, we can somehow play with this moment more loyally so as not to lose regular customers. We didn’t just come from the street, didn’t order anything and sat down “with our own”. In general, there was a residue left, I don’t know if I will continue to visit this cafe as often as before.\n\nUpd.
