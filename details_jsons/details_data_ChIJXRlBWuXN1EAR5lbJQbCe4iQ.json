do not understand how this place can have such a low rating. This place has a great food selection, the quality of the ingredients and the presentation on the plate is top notch. Not to mention the really comfy seats and chilled mood that compliments the amazing meals.\nThe staff is really polite and attentive of your needs, and most importantly (at least for me) have a general knowledge of English, some are a bit more fluent some a bit less but as a foreigner I've never encountered any problem ordering. On this subject I'd like to point out that our usual waitress, Nastya (you can recognize her by her tattoos and politeness), is a really good English speaker and surely knows how to make customers feel home and relaxed. This is, hands down, the best branch of this chain I've been so far.\nThe manager, together with all the staff I clouding the kitchen, surely deserve a raise in their salary for the good image that they present of this chain! üòâüòä\nI always order a lemonade with ginger, super good and refreshing, noodles with pork non spicy (once I ordered it normal by mistake, and by default was spicy, too hot for me at least), angld gyoza with pork.\nThe noodles have a great amount of clearly super fresh vegetables and pork thin slice fried with breadcrumbs, perfectly cooked. All the flavors blend together offering a great overall taste. The pork gyoza are surprisingly light, the lightest I tried, but still super tasty, I really enjoy them and it's hard not to order a second portion.\nOne really good thing about their food is the freshness, as said before, and the incredibly easy digestibility. Despite the amount of food I eat, I never feel heavy. The desserts are also great, especially the mini portions of Moti. What I would like to point out, in the end, is that the prices are more than honest for the level of service, place and quality of food and, most importantly, consistency: I've never felt like I was eating something that didn't quite taste like the previous time, no sir. Every time there is a good consistency of taste with the previous time. This is extremely important. You will always know what you'll taste.\n\nMaybe the bad reviews are due to a rough start at the opening, or maybe a change of management fixed problems. I really don't know, I only know that I've never had a problem in a year of going there at least twice a month. If not more.\n\nGreat restaurant!
