Particular attention should be paid to meat that is marinated and then fried on a regular grill (not electric), which creates a special taste (a little smoky); if you’re lucky, you can see the picture of frying the meat with your own eyes.\nThe meat tastes of high quality and is moderately well fried, the chicken really resembles chicken, as if it were fillet from a frying pan at home, only it’s tastier here!)\nIt can’t be compared to most shawarmen, where it’s usually not clear what kind of meat has been fried 20 times on an electric grill. In combination with the other elements of the roll, it’s generally delicious, I recommend everyone to try Beef, which combines veal with Teriyaki sauce very well!\n\nAmong other points, I would like to note the following:\nThe size of the rolls is a little smaller compared to shawarma for the same price, but not critical, and here there is an emphasis on quality, so there are no complaints about this.\n\nWhat I didn’t like: Not very friendly staff, once I came across Mikhail, it’s clear that the person loves his job and treats every client well, but other times there was a guy who takes orders with an “empty” face and silently gives roll. Perhaps this is my personal nitpicking, but as a rule, people like to be greeted, wished a good day, etc.\n\nOverall, I recommend everyone to visit this establishment!)", "time": 1581094426, "translated": true}, {"author_name": "Shawarma Man", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107692237144970093517/reviews", "language": "en-US", "original_language": "ru", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjXm7OUt1KmVG20dkf6bil2GhOo2llHR9AYgCo2RF5k4xA=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo", "rating": 4, "relative_time_description": "3 years ago", "text": "I have tried more than one roll and I can say that they have something unique.
