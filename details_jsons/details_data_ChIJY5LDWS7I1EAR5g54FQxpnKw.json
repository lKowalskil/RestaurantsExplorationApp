Bring your own cut!!! Salads consist mainly of cabbage leaves and croutons. Caviar is sour and under no circumstances take it on tartlets! It turned out to be red caviar on large crackers, very tasteless. Not all the water and not all the alcohol that we bought were laid out on the table; in the end, when asked where the rest was, the staff was surprised to take out our supplies from under the counter with the question: 《is this yours?》, we were simply shocked. They still managed to steal the fruit quite well, except that they put all the kiwi on the table, since we only bought 5 of them, but they took the apples, oranges and bananas very well, they definitely saved half of what they bought for themselves. I'm glad they got it wrong with the drinks! There is also a suspicion that out of two purchased cakes and one homemade one, they also took one purchased one for themselves, obviously they needed it more.\n\nConclusion: I do not recommend it!
