"UPDATED:\n\nI really enjoyed Don Pizza the first time I ordered pizza from them. Unfortunately, the last time I ordered from here, the pizza wasn’t very good. I’m giving it 3 stars because the first time I ordered, I thought it 5-star quality.\n\nThe pizza was very undercooked. It was flimsy, like pita bread. You can see in the pictures that the bottom of the pizza looks barely cooked and if you look closely, you can see that the crust is doughy. It was also impossible to taste the sauce.\n\nI will probably give Don pizza one more chance, but at this point, I wouldn’t recommend it.\n\nORIGINAL:\n\nI recently tried the margarita pizza at Don Pizza and was pleasantly surprised. The quality is top-notch, easily making it one of my top two pizza spots in Kyiv. While I rate it a solid 9/10, it’s important to note that this is more akin to a classic New York style cheese pizza rather than a traditional margarita. The dough has a thicker crust beneath the toppings and much chewier along the edge, diverging from the thin, puffy and crispy crust of the Neapolitan style; it also lacked the fresh basil and olive oil typical of a margarita. While the pizza was slightly undercooked on one side, the overall taste was still excellent. My only wish is for more vegetarian options. This place will definitely become my regular go-to spot for pizza in Kyiv, and I definitely recommend it to anyone craving a classic NY style pizza. I think they should keep up what they’re doing and focus on perfecting what is already a solid pizza.", "time": 1706374304, "translated": false}, {"author_name": "Светлана Минченко", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107411234220852359154/reviews", "language": "en-US", "original_language": "uk", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjXhyyW7yhTzGk3t_-ca46kw-UVbMH2xIWP_VuhSzEJVLnQ=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo", "rating": 5, "relative_time_description": "3 months ago", "text": "This is not the first time I have ordered here, I have picked up both by pickup and delivery.
