"It was not the first time I was in this establishment. But on 02.03, my husband and I came to this establishment, ordered another caesar salad, khachapuri and two types of meat. Drinks were brought to us right away, and they brought salad, and then Caesar. Caesar simply shocked me with its appearance - instead of parmesan cheese, some cheap cheese was grated, the consistency was not parmesan at all. It was difficult to call them bacon, because they were fried strips of brisket. Horror. But at my remark, the waitress, and as it turned out later, she is also the administrator, took the salad and said that she would convey my remark to the cook. We waited for a salad for about 40 minutes, probably ran for cheese))) Khachapuri was delicious, no questions here. But most of the drinks stated in the menu are not available, the meat served was tasteless and dry. I don't see how you can spoil a neck and a chicken thigh like that. But in this institution they can. And a thigh kebab is also announced, so be prepared that it will be with cartilage and bone, and in addition with skin. As for sauces, there is also trash barbecue sauce - based on ketchup, herbs, onions, no questions. Adjika is a complete farce - the same chili ketchup, diluted with water and more spicy. I asked the waiter-administrator again why they were the same, but she just went around and said that this is how they serve it in their establishment. But sorry, adjika cannot be confused with anything. Regarding meat and how it is weighed, there are also questions. But that's enough. And instead of apologizing for so many moments, they still walk around and behave arrogantly. I understand that divorce with cheese did not go well and there were comments. Normal establishments that value their customers do not allow such a relationship. Although the bill was not small. And the icing on the cake is that this salad, which we refused, was ordered for another table.
