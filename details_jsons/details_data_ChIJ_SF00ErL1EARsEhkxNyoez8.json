I think that next time I can call the police and write a complaint to the sanitary and epidemiological station, since it is precisely because of such irresponsible “individuals” that our country still has high disease rates. I wouldn’t be surprised if, after drinking coffee, you acquire a bunch of various infections. Who knows, maybe someone sneezed into your drink.\n\nThe second point is the complete lack of education on the part of the owner of the establishment. I didn’t think that an adult man could behave like that with people around him and express himself rudely in front of children. Therefore, if your child has not learned to speak, feel free to take him to coffee kids by drivemafia, where he will learn the delights of all the languages ​​of the world (though not entirely cultural ones)\n\nThird, cutting down trees in front of the establishment. I thought that after so many environmental incidents in the world, our people would think about the consequences of cutting down at least one tree. But no! As there was chaos, so it will be. It took the oak 20 years to take root, to release the oxygen that our children, and indeed we ourselves, breathe. But then a “man” appeared in the Petrovsky Quarter residential complex, who decided that he didn’t care about nature, he didn’t care about the future generation - he could cut down every living thing and go unpunished. The most offensive thing is that in our beautiful neighborhood there are still people who visit this establishment and thus approve of cruel crimes against the environment.\n\nIn general, I can call it all escapism. If similar things happened abroad, we would all unanimously transfer money to charities and post hundreds of stories on Instagram about how sorry we are. But when it comes to our own place of residence, we are all silent. Yes, of course, let’s allow such chaos to grow, but then not a single Ukrainian bill will help us resolve this situation, so don’t even dare complain about how bad our lives are. Our Petrovsky quarter is a mirror of ourselves. And in this mirror I see a rude owner, staff who do not comply with the law of Ukraine, and a disregard for nature.\n\nIf you have even a drop of self-respect, walk past this hellish cafe.
