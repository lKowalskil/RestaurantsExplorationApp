The woman who stands in the meat department first sorts out the fish with gloves on, and then uses the same glove to put the minced meat in a bag for me!!!\n3. Last time some inadequate woman who screamed at the whole store opened all the products on the shelves, from sour cream to sausages, all completely! And after that I put the products back in their place! The security guard didn't react to this at all!!\n4.The security guard is inadequate!!! He made a comment to me about a dog that was sitting in a cart (where children are placed). After the remark, 1 minute later, I was already standing at the checkout to pay for the groceries! And quickly leave the store. BUT the security guard starts filming me and threatening me with the police!! Because I put the dog in a dirty cart! Excuse me!!! I understand that some stores are against dogs and do not allow this, for example in Silpo. BUT WHAT RIGHT DO YOU HAVE TO TAKE A VIDEO AND POKE YOUR PHONE WITHOUT WARNING ME? IT’S NOT THAT I’M DISGUSTING TO PLACE GOODS IN THIS CART, I’M DISGUSTING TO PLACE THE DOG IN THIS BLACK DIRT CART!!!! MAKE NORMAL CONDITIONS FOR PEOPLE AND PEOPLE WILL ALSO FOLLOW YOUR RULES! PLEASE AT LEAST WASH THE FLOOR IN THIS STORE SO THAT YOUR SHOES DO NOT STICK TO THE FLOOR!!! And then make your own rules. If this store were really clean and tidy, believe me, they would treat you differently!!!\n5. During the head start, the door handle is broken. They've already covered it with tape, they've already tried to repair it, but this handle keeps falling off.
