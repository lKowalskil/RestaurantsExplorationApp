"Disappointed with tonight's dinner. Gaga used to work for quality, but now - only for the number of orders, especially on a weekend. A table for three was found, even though it was in a passageway. The waitress took the order after several requests, about 15 minutes after boarding. The waiter did not warn that the main course would take about an hour to prepare. Salad, khachapuri were brought out within 50-55 minutes, and lyula was brought at the end (that is, almost an hour after ordering). 1. Cucumber and tomato salad included huge cucumbers, the size of zucchini, fodder cucumbers with a corresponding taste. 2. Beef loin was brought simply white with a light pink tint. To be honest, I was shocked. Those who eat only veal will understand what I'm talking about. This meat should be light to dark brown in finished form. They asked to fry it. They brought our lyula after 5 minutes, we take it - it's cold. How did you warm it up, if it is cold and the outside is unchanged? They asked to fry the already hungry ones again. They brought an already warm, but equally beige, beef stew. It is not clear what is wrong with him. Whether it was for ice cream mincemeat, or it was undercooked three times... They didn't eat it, they took it to the dog. For this service (lower than average) 10% more in the check. Khinkali and khachapuri are more or less tasty. This was my last visit to this chain of establishments. I already told my friends that Gaga let me down. You understand that 1 unsatisfied guest means at least 5 people in his entourage who will find out about it in all colors.
