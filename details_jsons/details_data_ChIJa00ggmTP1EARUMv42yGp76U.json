I frankly did not smell the barbecue in the pork and there was less cheese. She more or less kept her shape. Shawarma, as mentioned, without cabbage, there were pieces of tomatoes.\nI will say right away that I understand that shawarma is not a dish that can be easily delivered in a good form. But the weight should correspond, it is better to think about packaging and cooking. It seemed that they had been grilled for quite a while.\n\nP/S wrote the comment in Glovo.
