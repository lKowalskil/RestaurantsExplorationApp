I have had several dishes but my favorite and constant order is the yellow rice \"плов.\" This is definitly not your average cafeteria foo. They have a small selection is desserts but they are very tasty. My favorite dessert is the poppy blinchiky.  Cost wise this is average: one item dish and tea (70 hrv). My favorite tea is the imberni ginger, lemon and honey tea.\n\nMy only complaint is of the misunderstanding when I asked for another cup of tea. Instead of regular tea of: ginger, lemon and honey, I was given hot water, orange juice and orange slices. Upon receiving this, I went up to the drinks order section and asked if this had lemons and ginger. Although they swore that it did, I double checked and it did not.
