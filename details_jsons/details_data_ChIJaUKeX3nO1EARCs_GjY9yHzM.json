Production by Splash Theater Studio\nMore than a day has passed, and it‚Äôs still difficult to say something specific. I had a teacher at the university, and it seems to me that she really didn‚Äôt like the word ‚Äúlike.‚Äù So here it is. Sorry! I still haven‚Äôt learned to remove it from sentences when I describe something literary and interesting I‚Äôve read or seen. Or not very interesting, it happens in different ways :) I liked so many things yesterday! The acting, minimalism in the scenery, costumes, music, words... How well the words are thought out! Everything is so well thought out! I heard a spoiler, but I completely forgot about it, as I promised :) Aleksei Yatsuta was completely different from how I recognized him in class. It was him, that gopnik and villain. A very bad person! How I didn‚Äôt like him! I hated him from the very beginning of the performance, my hands folded into a Napoleon pose and so on until the very end, periodically, in especially lyrical places, distracted by characteristic movements. Fists clenched and fingers crunched. After the performance there was a discussion of what we had seen, and I understood what had happened to the hands. Hands kept control! I wanted to fuck you so bad! Break into the performance and tear it to pieces. And it‚Äôs hard to be like that! Or become. From the very beginning, from the first minutes, you hate the hero and you understand that this will continue to happen, but you can‚Äôt do anything. You can‚Äôt do it now, but you can in a similar situation. You're desperate. For justice and other good and loud words. During the same discussion, we once again came to the conclusion that the more desperate a person is, the faster he gets into a fight, such a fight as was shown. It‚Äôs like with the poor and the rich, the poor one will give away the last thing faster than the rich one will give away what he doesn‚Äôt really need anyway. And then another storm of emotions that are very difficult to explain. And at one moment it seems that you hate the reality that exists, you hate it so much that you are glad that you are surrounded by people who are ready for change, who know that to change the world, you need to start with yourself. And you want to do something. And you do.\nWhy am I doing all this?\nThank you, theater studio \"SPLASH\"! Thank you!\n\n#splash_drama_school #metro #splash #splash #splashtheater #theater #performance", "time": 1481042136, "translated": true}, {"author_name": "Anna Miroshnychenko", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103677456458854695106/reviews", "language": "en-US", "original_language": "uk", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjWqBhdqF1gytGXbvPc19h10q_zW92oybpQbTo-Z6xE5DYc=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba2", "rating": 4, "relative_time_description": "4 years ago", "text": "The place is atmospheric, although it needs care and reconstruction.", "time": 1553371344, "translated": true}, {"author_name": "Andrei Oleron", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106613180808030676820/reviews", "language": "en-US", "original_language": "uk", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjWOYqccig7aP_fRMuG8LazuOYdT5_wHf5mhqS7tbtb7vrk=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo", "rating": 5, "relative_time_description": "5 years ago", "text": "We were here as guests of the Wild Theater at the Gay Parade.\nBefore that, they were several times on stage #6.\nThe gay parade is a wonderful show.\nThe only annoying thing is that there is a delay of 15 minutes at the beginning and laggards that interfere with focusing on the beginning.\nThe building itself is old and neglected.", "time": 1528912447, "translated": true}, {"author_name": "–ö–∞—Ç—Ä–∏–Ω–∞ –§–∞–π–Ω–∞", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110887850731864119091/reviews", "language": "en-US", "original_language": "ru", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjWp7pniNvUaALAt6PSBPpNiUW4Zo7SIuD8ZjwkYq464wCc=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba5", "rating": 3, "relative_time_description": "5 years ago", "text": "We attended the Kleizmer concert and really liked the music!
