I tasted their pizza three times — and for me it positively stands out from the rest. I will explain.\n\nYou have to realize that this is not the classic pizza that you are used to eating. The name of the service clearly reflects its essence: an American variation of pizza (Chicago) — with a high side and a very large amount of toppings. Peven, many people still like the saturation of ingredients (in the same homemade pizza, for example, as they are used to doing in families). I'll say it frankly: you're already full with two pieces. After three - extremely. So, considering this amount of filling, taste and delivery, the price can be considered justified.\n\nAll three times I've tasted their pizza, the ingredients have not disappointed me. They are really tasty and good in combination. Separately, I would like to mention their cream sauce from Dor Blue (I tasted it on a BBQ pizza) - I really liked it. If you love cheese, you will hardly regret it. Many also noted that the dough was not very good. I liked. It is soft, has its own easily pronounced pleasant taste, which is also good.\n\nRegarding delivery time. Just keep in mind: their location is remote, there may be a lot of orders, because of which you will have to wait for your order. However, the manager can inform you about the delivery time by phone. So, it is not critical, because you are informed.\n\nProbably, some people tend to hyperbolize certain shortcomings, which, of course, they have subjectively singled out for themselves — and to such an extent that it is possible to \"destroy\" the institution's reputation. Given the situation, I would like to support this establishment, because there are not too many places in Ukraine that prepare such an unusual and really tasty format of pizza as Chicago.", "time": 1695507451, "translated": true}, {"author_name": "Яна", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104475846724078382365/reviews", "language": "en-US", "original_language": "uk", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjUPM14Xn-d3GNOF_uRYrmw1coOxpybA6sMs8IySTgkCJPI=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo", "rating": 1, "relative_time_description": "3 months ago", "text": "Pizza is really terrible, especially for such a price of almost 1000 hryvnias.
