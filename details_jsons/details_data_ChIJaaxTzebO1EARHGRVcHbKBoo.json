The interior is modern and looks cozy enough.\nThe staff was not immediately friendly. I got the impression that the waitress who served us behaved as if she had recently been fired, underpaid and forced to overwork.\nThey set us an inadequately small table for 10 people, which, as far as I understand, was ordered in advance. It was a bit cramped and it turned out that some people were forced to sit almost on the corners of the table. There was an empty large table nearby. There were also other options to increase our table by placing it on a different side. In general, there were no other customers in the hall except for us. Why was such a small table set for us - it looked like it was convenient for the staff, and they were not very interested in the comfort of customers. Maybe they covered it to the size of the oilcloth that was laid on our table, why? - I think not to wash the covered tablecloth afterwards. Because the table was too small, everything on it was jammed together and there was not a single free place. Without paying attention to the actuality, without \"extra\" questions, they very quickly began to bring out \"hot\" dishes one by one, and put them on other plates, partially pressing the food into them. Something was dropped from one plate to another. Perhaps they were in a hurry somewhere, although it was only afternoon.\nSome dishes were spoiled, Greek salad, cabbage rolls, something else... It seems that they were prepared yesterday and were not kept in the refrigerator all this time, I think it was about +- somewhere, the +35 temperature on board, which had been there for several days, could also help. The desire to try all the dishes disappeared very quickly. Something was deteriorating very noticeably, something was just beginning. The meat patties were more or less normal, only maybe a little too much breadcrumbs were added to the minced meat. The borscht was quite fresh, but the taste was 3 points out of 10, at first I rated it as a 2, then I poured more pepper and salt and somehow ate it. Boiled potatoes with the addition of something similar to butter with a bad taste, I don't know what it is, or very old and cheap butter or margarine of some kind. The concoction was very tasty, a good recipe and ingredients, by the way, one of the best I've tried in general, respect for that.\nIf the dishes will be fresh, perhaps this often happens to you, it is felt that the cook will still be appropriate to review and update the recipe of some dishes. I suggest to the management to check and improve the storage conditions of ready meals and ingredients. I also suggest to go, for example, to the canteen of the shipbuilding plant on the outskirts, and try their dishes, maybe adopt something.\nBut I don't know if there will be any desire to change anything if everything is fine with the customers? can the staff", "time": 1692140826, "translated": true}, {"author_name": "Bohdan Bochkovskyi", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111186228930389147387/reviews", "language": "en-US", "original_language": "ru", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjXGJzAxAz3i42LX4w61xxBDk-tq07kf_69mxAS3P0Im8F2U=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba3", "rating": 5, "relative_time_description": "4 years ago", "text": "The cafe is cozy, clean, not very big, which is rather a plus.
