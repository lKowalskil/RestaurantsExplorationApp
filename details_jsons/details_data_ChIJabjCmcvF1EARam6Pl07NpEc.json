They were late even with the new delivery terms. As a result, instead of 18:15-18:30, it arrived at 19:50. They offered to make a bonus for the next order. Is it calculated that with such a service I will order again? No, they simply decided not to lose on this order. That is, the policy is such that they do not think about keeping customers. Ok, I did not receive compensation. Let's go further. The appearance is quite different for the worse. Weighed The set is 880 grams, in fact with packaging - 800 grams. That is, the difference is not less than 100 grams. Let's go further - some of the rolls were simply almost without filling, wrapped and cut as needed, some sets were specially wrapped in rice one and a half times in order to increase the mass at the expense of rice, I am attaching a photo. Unfortunately, I didn't take a picture of the weight, it was 800, for some reason I thought it was only 800, but in fact, when I started writing the review, I saw that it should have been 880 grams.
