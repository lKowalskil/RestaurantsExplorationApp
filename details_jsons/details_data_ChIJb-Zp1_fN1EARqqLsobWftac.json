The dish is very tasty, it differs from the classic shawarma in that yogurt is put here instead of ketchup, it is not spicy and low-fat, which is more useful than shawarma. Some may find it dry due to the lack of ketchup, add another drink, it will taste better.\nIt doesn't take long to prepare, the gyros I tried tasted good and never failed. I liked the meat, yogurt and vegetable filling. The meat is soft and juicy, a wonderful combination with yogurt is something incredible, nicer than ketchup and mustard. From vegetables, I liked cucumbers, onions and salad, yogurt is also delicious, goes with any ingredient. The thickness of the pita seemed normal to me, neither thin nor thick, it was also tasty.\nThe size of gyros is large, and this applies not only to the size and thickness of the pita, but also to the filling, there is enough of it, you can fill up.\nGyros are actively advertised through flyers distributed in shopping centers, the advertising works. Here, many people still want to get to know Greek cuisine better. It's nice that someone is breaking the monotony and introducing Ukrainians to other analogues of the usual kebab.
