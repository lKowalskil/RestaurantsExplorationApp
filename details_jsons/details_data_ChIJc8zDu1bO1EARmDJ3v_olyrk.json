I really liked this place before.\n\nI ordered bowl of Ramen and some allegedly Thai-style noodles. I didn't like neither. Ramen broth tasted everything but Japanese, and the egg in it was just a half of a hard boiled egg - don't expect any soft-boiled ajitsuke or whatever you expected for your 139uah. If these are your expectations (as mines were), just go to the Ramen shop in 15m from here - Menya Musashi.\n\nAs for noodles, they just lack a bit of love. The main problem is sauce, it doesn't have anything to do with Thailand.\n\nThe only thing that saved my lunch that day was their cranberry cider. If it so happened and you found your self eating here, it can be something that cheer you up :)\n\nP.S. I went there for a second time yesterday 31/01). Don't even think ordering Ceasar salad!
