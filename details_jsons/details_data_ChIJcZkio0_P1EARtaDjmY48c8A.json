INKI People is an innovative format of themed parties that take place in Kyiv every month. Parties are held in trilogies: every 3 parties are united by one theme, and each separately has a sub-theme (for example, a trilogy in the theme Space: Spaceship, Planet/Hotel Halloween, Future/Cyber ‚Äã‚ÄãPunk). The theme of the party affects the dress code, decorations and entertainment at the location - there are no more rules, no tension, tips and ideas are always given according to the dress code. I really like preparing looks for parties, it allows you to be creative and be different and new, even for yourself)\n\nThe locations are always different and, as a rule, are intriguing - these were Kyiv clubs, a hotel, the VDNKh pavilion, a theater, and an architectural mansion! The party had high-quality lighting and sound, and the laser show was amazing. During the party, costumed appearances of actors/dancers among the guests take place - sometimes these appearances are simply amazing! For example, huge ‚Äúaliens‚Äù or robots. The only note is that registration at the entrance is slow, and you always have to stand in line, although you want to immediately dive into the magical world)\n\nSeparately about music! For me, this is the most important component of the event, since I come to dance. Music is a matter of taste, and depending on the DJ lineup, it can be different. But this is definitely always high-quality techno! Melodic techno, house and sub-genres. I love something fun, explosive, with a powerful bass and beat - and often I get what I came for)\n\nAs for the public: a typical Inca member is a lover of nightlife, a music lover, an open-minded, easy-going and secular person. Creativity in creating an image is valued; at a party everyone checks out each other) It‚Äôs normal to smile and give compliments to strangers. It's okay to dance from the heart) It's very easy to start talking to someone and get to know them.\n\nI am inspired and admired by the story of the project organizers. Sasha and Inna are a bright couple of beautiful, brave and creative people who love parties and live their dreams, gathering around them the same bright and cheerful guys. I have been visiting INKI for more than six months now, and every party for me is a long-awaited event and an exciting adventure!
