the first and last time with my company in this \"premium\" (as they repeated to me 10 times at the entrance) institution. Let's start with the dress code. I was wearing a tracksuit and sneakers. Well, the dress code is not mentioned anywhere, except on the tickets to the event. There is no such information on the website and in instagram, I was not told anything when booking a table, and we went to the live music without any tickets. But, the security guard and the administrator (by the way, the first was dressed in a military-type black sports suit, and the second in a T-shirt, pants and light green sneakers, oh, and a jacket... funny) for some reason decided to \"shine\" their minds and said that there is a dress-code, although I specifically showed in my smartphone that this is a lie. Further, I told the administrator that this is not good behavior from your side, he said nothing except we're a \"premium\" place... The waiters in white sneakers (it must be a dress code) and a black top. Surprisingly, a few people came into the place, mostly girls, dressed, neither in casual nor in dresses, but some tights, sneakers and t-shirts, and were quietly let through. The courtyard, music and karaoke from the other room constantly interfered with the live music in the \"premium\" restaurant. There were only 7! people in the restaurant itself with us, with a total of about 50 seats, I can't say exactly. The prices are overpriced (don't forget this is a \"premium\" restaurant)... At the same time they do not bring a glass for beer, beer in a glass was not poured by the waiter (guys, even in more modest places this is an ordinary procedure). Anyway, that was our experience. There's a lot of pathos, not much output. Some people with \"janitor's syndrome\" decide whether you will spend money here or not. We sat there for an hour (yeah they let me in after some time my friend asked again) and went to another place where we got a great attitude, service and mood! Decide if you need it and have a great time somewhere else ;)", "time": 1686518981, "translated": false}, {"author_name": "Vitaliy Pasternak", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100574283258040939863/reviews", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocKb0S7DsAmS3vx9yail06EdQ1jcmPG-O0vg44GO2F4K=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo", "rating": 5, "relative_time_description": "5 months ago", "text": "Best of The Best.", "time": 1696455867, "translated": false}, {"author_name": "oksanka lunevych", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106176269940435708381/reviews", "language": "en-US", "original_language": "uk", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocKqSvoc82kfYtoWF_b6d-biT5HQm36e4rjAQLD1c9om=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo", "rating": 5, "relative_time_description": "in the last week", "text": "my most favorite place is boho yosai. here are the most delicious cocktails in Kyiv, especially Mai Tai and Riki Tiki are my favorites :) also very tasty cuisine and hookah. service as always at the highest level. highly recommended for a visit!) highly recovered", "time": 1710400720, "translated": true}, {"author_name": "Andrew Korovin", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105853477251697680356/reviews", "language": "en-US", "original_language": "uk", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjXyHRQ8QVRFjzS_DDQjK3hZZLJEHQT1a367u1GPrmzFVzxB=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba4", "rating": 2, "relative_time_description": "2 months ago", "text": "Many have heard and recommended this establishment to me, but I was not a little disappointed after visiting.\nBeautiful, very aesthetic and stylish, but crowned staff and arrogant visitors who look down on everyone do not harmonize.
