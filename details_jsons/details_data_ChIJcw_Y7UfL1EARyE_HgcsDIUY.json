Although when I arrived 10 minutes later at the facility, there was an Asobi branded car parked next to it. What is the problem of bringing an order that was spoiled due to the fault of an unknown institution?\n\nThe cuisine is delicious, but the service is terrible!

Admin says forgot! I wanted to return to the card (45 UAH!!! From an order for 500, when the discount is 50% on Monday, taking into account that the order was for 500 UAH), the staff seems to be there, and there are no complaints about the staff at all - they do as they say! Forgot means forgot! The establishment is not bad considering the quality of the dishes and their taste, for many years I was very surprised how such an establishment is declining, I even thought of taking a franchise, the food is very decent, and it could be like a poppy, but now they have already closed the pizza, although I have never tasted it! and sushi - everyone I brought there - satisfied, even more than possible! However, there are many shoals in service - and this put an end to this institution!!! I will refuse all of them and will not order here again! However, I emphasize - everything is cool, but not the place where such cuisine is appreciated, the second - contemptuous attitude towards the staff (from the owners, that is, they recruit everyone, not those who would develop the establishment) - this is also crucial! Although very tasty! I didn't find such cuisine in Kyiv, but I'd rather eat where it's not tasty - at least don't fool around with discounts and offers! If you look at the screenshots and photos, you will see that I did not receive a discount (this is not the first time, but the reaction is the first), so they gave me a hot dog as a gift !!! I didn't ask for it, and it doesn't taste very good at all (it feels like the new chef wants to show something!!! But it didn't work out)\nHe also left a tip - it is not clear why! and already at home, the girl said that I \"stuck\" - it was not important to me, and I would not have paid attention! BUT this happened, and not for the first time, so goodbye! Probably they will make sushi like pizza!\nSo the conclusion:\nThe potential was huge, but without the care of the owner, the restaurant lost everything - the potential, the ability to develop, and the visitors.\nP.S. I ordered self-delivery, and even if I were given a discount, it would be more profitable to order self-delivery of these products on any other day with a 10% discount (it would be more profitable for about UAH 7), this is the disadvantage of the Monday promotion, when I ordered for 500 and received BI 40 discount, because the cheapest dish is considered! Then when it is stated that every second dish is 50% cheaper!
