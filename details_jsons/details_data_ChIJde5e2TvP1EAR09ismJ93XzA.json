here back in April 2019 when I came out to visit Chernobyl and Pripyat. The hotel was very good, staff were nice and friendly and even phoned for a taxi for us back to the airport when we left. We had an economy room on the 16th floor looking towards the Dnipro River and the heart of the city with nice big opening windows. The economy rooms are very basic but spotlessly clean. Beds were nice comfortable. I give this hotel 4 star due to there not being tea/coffee making facilities in the room and there was only 1 pillow on each bed. However I do think the hotel staff will provide you with these if you ask for them, we just didn't bother.

Light is yellow color like in the 80-90s. Service is terrible once I called and they just put the phone on hold and did not respond. In the restaurant waiters asking tips as it MUST be.
