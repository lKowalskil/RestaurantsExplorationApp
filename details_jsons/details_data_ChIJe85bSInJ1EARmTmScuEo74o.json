The photo is also from that time.\nBUT: NOT EVERYTHING is like that now! That's why she took the star.\n\nLet me explain:\n\n1. Made an order.\nThey brought roles and...money. As I later understood - there is no money for a role that is not available. No one called to warn. They just deposited money. And for that, thank you. It's not exactly bad, but it's 2 minutes to call and clarify. Communication and politeness is also the key to keep people coming back to you! I was already ready to run and give the taxi driver money, because I thought it was his. It's good that I looked at the order first and made a logical chain. I understand that there may be no ingredients and I am fine with that, but it would be nice if they called and warned. :)\n2. Tom Yum…Sorry, but this is a parody. It tastes sour. Shitaki rubber. The broth is not at all like in Tom Yum... here it's just like water and chili. Didn't finish. Very strange taste, so I don't recommend it if you really want this particular soup. I will definitely not order here again.\n3. Baked roll: since when is there regular grated cheese? The feeling of eating a sandwich. This roll used to melt in the mouth. And now this cheese under the cap is still unbaked. Maybe it was there before, but then it was definitely baked so that all the cheese melted and there was not a single piece of ordinary cheese. Before, it seemed that there was some cheese cream mass. Now it's not like that at all.\n4. The packaging is now plastic. There used to be paper. Purely from the point of view of ecology, I am more in favor of paper, but I understand that the war may not be possible to order such packaging, or the economy. Here you can somehow find an explanation. Therefore, approx.\n5. The other rolls were delicious. Delivery is not very long. But in general, the impression has deteriorated somewhat. That's why I took one star.\n6. FINALLY the operator speaks Ukrainian!! +\n\nWill I order again?
