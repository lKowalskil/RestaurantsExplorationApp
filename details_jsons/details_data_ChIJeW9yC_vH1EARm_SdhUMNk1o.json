Dear community, I wanted to drink fragrant coffee in this place today. Until today, the coffee was tasty and good, but today it is clear that something went wrong in the shop, between the conversations, the buyer came on the phone, and distracted from the interesting conversation. Apparently, that's why the coffee tasted like slop.\nWhen I asked what the problem was and what happened to the coffee, I was told that the coffee is good and that these are your problems, not mine. After asking where I can see the buyer's corner, the saleswoman generally closed herself in the kiosk and hid. But after some time, an unknown man approached and offered to return the money to me, of course I took the money. Thanks for that too. After I took the funds, a few minutes later, this person in the photo above approached me and rudely began to poke me and threaten me that I brought her to tears with my questions to the seller. He started taking pictures of my car and threatening me with physical violence.\nWhat can I say if you want to exercise your day and mood for the whole day, drink coffee here.\nAnd I probably won't be anymore", "time": 1634284261, "translated": true}, {"author_name": "–í—è—á–µ—Å–ª–∞–≤ –¢–æ–ª—Å—Ç–æ–∫–æ—Ä–æ–≤", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105739197582859128553/reviews", "language": "en-US", "original_language": "ru", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjWSuC1de4Mo0np4yM4_gQG8VXLcPrl-Nam5yFwAqDSQpzEi=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba4", "rating": 4, "relative_time_description": "2 years ago", "text": "üëå", "time": 1638955264, "translated": true}, {"author_name": "Sia Kim", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109309078102331105957/reviews", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjVbsD5wStRwwocRzlT0p6IVE7nO_lMjkUH7n7CCAsG-dA=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo", "rating": 5, "relative_time_description": "8 months ago", "text": "", "time": 1687879205, "translated": false}], "takeout": true, "types": ["cafe", "store", "food", "point_of_interest", "establishment"], "url": "https://maps.google.com/?cid=6526574868645672091", "user_ratings_total": 10, "utc_offset": 120, "vicinity": "Kyiv"}, "status": "OK"}
