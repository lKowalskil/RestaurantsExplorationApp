Having worked myself in the restaurant industry for 12 years there’s not much I don’t know about the workings of a restaurant.\n\nWhere to start? After being seated and given the menus with many options on and spending 15 minutes deciding, when the waiter comes to take our order, it’s now apparent that half the menu is actually missing and they don’t have much to order? (Why didn’t the waiter say that when we sat down?)\n\nSecondly, the little food we did manage to order from the waiter came before the drinks ever arrived the waiter forgot our drinks and only bought one small bottle of water with one glass to share with three people, the olives looked out of date and past their service. There was about three tables in the restaurant and the three service staff were looking stressed out over nothing?\n\nWhen we asked for the bill, the bill of course being in Ukrainian was hard for us to understand but it was clear that all the things we had ordered that never came or they did not have had not been taken off the bill, it felt like they wanted us to pay quickly before we realized but we did have it corrected. There was no apology for the entire disappointing experience from the restaurant staff.\n\nOn arrival the restaurant looks cosy with a good menu but this was not the case that evening. The staff could have explained or at least said sorry.\n\nIt was our first night in Kyiv and all we could do was laugh about the strange experience at MOKA Tapas y vino restaurant and left more hungry than when we arrived so much so that we had McDonald’s on the way home.\n\nPerhaps it was a one off?
