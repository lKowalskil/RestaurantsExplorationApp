review to these guys after about 10 orders from them.

We found on the map that this establishment is open until 10 p.m., we didn’t read the reviews, and we went in on chance. Yes, the establishment has moments where it needs to be renovated, but ok, they were going to take it with them anyway. We arrived at 21:40, the guys took the order without any problems. The order was completed in 10 minutes and they also gave a 15% discount, everything was packed in a beautiful package. The houses were opened, the sushi is beautiful, and most importantly incredibly tasty..\nNow I only order sushi from them.\nThe guys are always punctual and friendly! And the sushi is very tasty!\nI just ordered it yesterday too (order #71942). I placed my order in advance and the guys, as always, did not disappoint!
