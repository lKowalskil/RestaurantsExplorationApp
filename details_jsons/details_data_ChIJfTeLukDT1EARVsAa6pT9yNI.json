Delicious coffee, everything was fine. And so today they were walking with the child, and the son wanted to sit on a chair near the coffee shop, because he was tired, and eat his bun. We didn't buy anything in the coffee shop today.\nThere were two chairs, one was occupied by my son, I stood next to him. There were no customers in the cafe, and even one chair was free. 3 minutes later the barista guy came out and not very politely told the kid to get up from their chair. I asked again, like what.. he said to take the child from the chair, because it is only for customers. I said: so a small child can't sit on a chair for 5 minutes? He said: no, you can't.\nJust a shock...\n\nThis is the case when, for example, if a person becomes ill, then in this coffee shop, not only will they not give a glass of water, but they will also kick the person out of their chair in such a condition. It often happened to me that when I got sick, people would come out and offer to sit down themselves, bring out a chair, a bottle of water. This is so, for example. And then, with a stony face, they simply told the little child to get up from the chair.\nThe son is in shock, he says that he didn't do anything bad to them, he doesn't understand why... And I don't understand how it's possible...\nJust the bottom.", "time": 1703170810, "translated": true}, {"author_name": "Микола Прис", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114883931359561955740/reviews", "language": "en-US", "original_language": "uk", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocIC3qZo5PIzRFmya7iC2bzu8ez0tVABDphp0pbwI43t=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo", "rating": 5, "relative_time_description": "4 years ago", "text": "The best coffee!
