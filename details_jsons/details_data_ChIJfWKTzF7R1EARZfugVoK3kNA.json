A large assortment of carnal pleasures for both Gentlemen and Ladies (though the quality is poor). Here you can enjoy the variety of musical selections and please the eye with the impeccable choreography of local bohemia. The establishment is truly huge, here you can sink into the sofas, or you can modestly hide behind a column on a wooden pedestal (which can serve you both as an object of self-defense and as a rescue shield). There are two stages on stage where you will certainly be shown lessons in seduction. The kitchen is not intended for an evening meal (it used to be delicious shawarma, but now it’s not so great) You can smoke near the toilet, but it’s annoying. There is a gambling room on the ground floor. If you're hungry, there's a McDrive around the corner, but if it's really hard, there's a 24-hour Silpo right opposite. Well, to be honest, this is a local 24-hour shelter, locals gather, dancing, scoundrels, fighting. The place is not for romantic dates and birthday celebrations (unless of course you are one of them). Such a place simply must be in every residential area of ​​the metropolis, a kind of outlet. The only thing that is really worthwhile there is the legendary “Chicken from Rubenchik”!! But it’s not so easy to get it because Ruben Mikhailovich himself must prepare it, and he is the manager. And the Chicken will not cost you the price of an ordinary worker, but to be honest, it’s worth it!!!!

We expected to stay there no more than an hour. As soon as we entered the hall, the waiter came up to us and offered us tables for a reservation of 500 UAH, and a table with a sofa for 800 UAH. We were not told that there were tables without a minimum order amount. After we repeated 3 times that we weren’t going to be long and weren’t going to book anything, the guy took us to the back of the hall and provided us with a table without a reservation. We ordered drinks and cold cuts. They brought our order for drinks🍺🥃🍷... We were waiting for the slices... Our companion went to the bar to remind us that not the whole order had been taken out, to which the waiter replied: - it’s being prepared. Cut an orange for 10 minutes!? ️ Well, okay, everything seemed fine after waiting.\nBut as soon as they brought the slices, most of my companions caught an unpleasant smell, which interrupted such a strong citrus aroma🍊... The smell was more like a fishy one🐟🤢. Suspicions arose that either the orange was cut with a knife that had previously been used to prepare fish, or that the fruit itself was saturated with the smell as a result of improper storage. They called the waiter, he said that he didn’t smell it, he went to the kitchen, came back and said that the knife used to cut the orange was clean. Having started to prove to the whole table that the foreign smell was still present and no one would eat it, the waiter suggested calling the administrator. A man immediately approached us... Without a badge, there was no indication that this was the manager. As we understood, this person was an administrator. (unfortunately, we didn’t recognize the name) The administrator immediately, without arguing or asking unnecessary questions, took the sliced ​​food and ordered it to be served again. Within two minutes there was a new cut on the table, the conflict was settled. Thank him very much, because if we started arguing with the waiter who smells like orange, there would be a scandal🤦‍♀️ many thanks to the administrator who worked on 8.12.18 shift at about 20:30👏 Thanks to him, the situation was saved. I give it an average rating based on the prices in this establishment and, of course, the attitude of the administrator. Unlike the waiter, he understands that “the customer is right,” especially if he did not touch the dish and asks to replace it.🍽️\n- it was not pleasant when the waiter said that he did not smell anything unusual in the smell of orange, although 5 people at the table said the opposite.\nYou could just go and immediately change the cut without creating awkward situations for yourself and the administrator of the establishment🤷‍♀️ after all, it’s just an orange🍊... Besides, after the second serve, he admitted that for him the orange had the smell of grass🌱... Something like this .\nAlso a minus is that from the entire bottled wine list there was only one wine option available (420 UAH per bottle)... I think that on weekends you need to replenish stocks, and there are about 20 wine items on the menu, but you can only order one.🍷\nI also advise you to retype the menu, otherwise the items added by hand look obscene, like a schoolboy’s rough draft.", "time": 1544332186, "translated": true}, {"author_name": "Борис А", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100021927511734046921/reviews", "language": "en-US", "original_language": "ru", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocLsGtclpYNzySkE_mKqtFroDLrOj_PoT-GJZLfmsoUv=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba6", "rating": 3, "relative_time_description": "5 years ago", "text": "Well, such a Handel - a night light.
