restaurant is a gem because of the fantastic people who work there. I accidentally noticed their outdoor menu on my way from “Favorite Uncle” restaurant which is around the corner. I was intrigued by Korean barbecue and decided to come in and see if it’s a real Korean barbecue. And it really was! The hostess guy who met me at the entrance was extremely sweet with a smile on his happy face and he showed me how everything looked inside because I was looking for nice place to meet with my friend that night. When we came there the same night it was not disappointing at all! Our waitress Stella was above and beyond! First of all, she is very welcoming and has a warm personality. She described meals with so much excitement that I wanted to try them all! I got a feeling that she loves her workplace a lot, so I was excited to stay there with my friend for quite a while. Secondly, Stella was very sincere describing meals. I’ve been to plenty of restaurants and being a good cook myself, it’s hard to deceive me when it comes to the quality of food. I really appreciate her honesty. I ordered much more then I planned, even the food she didn’t recommend for my taste, but I had so much fun! The atmosphere in this restaurant is like you came to a place in your neighborhood where everyone knows you. It’s definitely not for everyone, but if you’re tired of pathos the same as I am, you’ll love the vibes of this place. It’s very relaxing and feels like home.", "time": 1585515678, "translated": false}, {"author_name": "Olusegun Shina Ogunniyi", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105446989375977667391/reviews", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjWWZZcIiVhcYI7Y8gXPd7LH4lteC1S9N-f6RWQQz82XD1I=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba4", "rating": 5, "relative_time_description": "3 years ago", "text": "Service is good, waiters are polite and friendly, the food taste really nice and delicious and the price is very normal for a restaurant in Kyiv center.", "time": 1603391109, "translated": false}, {"author_name": "Nazar Demchuk", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108655006390686737325/reviews", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjV_gmS-Q0U0fW9ECUJYohHgk83gEzG4mZ63WzhGYjhcnhY=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba5", "rating": 3, "relative_time_description": "4 years ago", "text": "This is not real Chinese restaurant, and lady forget one dish from my order :) waiting around  25 minutes my order, when there are 2 people inside :)) also prices are not so low.

The servers are more professional now compared to before when I always felt like the people there serving me were just friends of the owner with some time to kill. The menus are now glossy photo books with Chinese and non-Chinese offerings, further cementing it as a middle-market establishment better suited to the non-discerning. They have retained several of the dishes from the old menu that were closer to authentic Chinese and, as before, they are okay. Still go there out of convenience.\n\nOLD: Standards in service and food not very high. I go there out of convenience in location. Mid-market. Dining room adequately comfortable.
