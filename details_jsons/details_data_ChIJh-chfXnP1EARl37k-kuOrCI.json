It is not cozy, I hope there will be changes for the better, because the restaurant has just opened. The furniture is also not the first freshness. The bathroom is small, modest. Regarding cleanliness, I have no comments. In general, this whole seafood bar is without ponts. But for those who want to taste lobsters at a moderate price, this place is a godsend. Lobsters are freshly prepared. True, all dishes have to wait a long time. We had the boiled lobsters and they were excellent, in my opinion. The price for a large lobster is UAH 770. Interesting signature \"Shrimps on the balcony\" in orange - UAH 185. \"Portuguese-style octopus\" is nonsense, and it costs UAH 195. It seems that we were a little cheated, because they brought us small octopuses with potatoes, and not a piece of octopus, as written in the menu. Octopuses were there when the cat cried. We also bought \"ASPRA spicy salad with shrimp\" for 120 hryvnias. A strange combination of avocado and lemon in a pillow under the shrimp. May interest a gourmet. The table service is beautiful, there are fresh flowers and everything you need to eat lobster. I would like to note that the staff is very friendly, neat and attentive.\nCONCLUSION : It is worth visiting this restaurant for those who do not pay attention to the interior and small things, but just want to eat real delicious lobster at a reasonable price.", "time": 1536441849, "translated": true}, {"author_name": "Denys Glukhovets", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100733673172594108132/reviews", "language": "en-US", "original_language": "ru", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocI96QphiztR7j2CPeR8JCdNUu4wd8oXwgSEfI4LiYsb=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba2", "rating": 2, "relative_time_description": "5 years ago", "text": "The idea is good, but, unfortunately, neither the interior nor the kitchen (they don‚Äôt know how to cook sea creatures at all) does not live up to the restaurant.
