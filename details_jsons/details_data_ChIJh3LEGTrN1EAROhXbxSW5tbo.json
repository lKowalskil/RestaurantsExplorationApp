First time 5 stars, today 1 star. For the first time, everything was truly prepared and served with love and taste. Kubdari is sprinkled with pomegranate seeds and well greased with butter. The pilaf contained a sheet of thin lavash. The kebab in the pita bread had a ratio of kebab and vegetables of 1 to 1. Plus they gave us very tasty bread sticks, pide with egg and cheese and two bottles of Coca-Cola as a gift, and pleasant words and wishes were also written on all the boxes. I really, really liked it and today, with a group of friends, I recommended this particular establishment. We ordered again..and...I was very ashamed. Everything was cold, there were no gifts, there was no sprinkle of pomegranate, there was no pita bread in the pilaf. The boxes were not painted, and I’m generally silent about the kebab in pita bread. 95% vegetables and 5% meat. To avoid being unfounded, I attached a photo of a kebab in lavash... and it’s not clear where the kebab itself is.\nThe shift that worked on September 21, 2020, you are the best. Shift working on October 2, 2020, I am very disappointed with you and you have greatly disgraced me in front of the company.\nAs a conclusion, going to this establishment is like roulette. If you’re lucky, it’s good, if it’s today’s shift, then you know what troubles you should be prepared for.", "time": 1601657626, "translated": true}, {"author_name": "Evgenia Chasovnikova", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101236027021598429394/reviews", "language": "en-US", "original_language": "ru", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjVk_CYMNIs13eAZRRiy-9lzeujVPdBEMcnahk9QWChkwA=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba3", "rating": 3, "relative_time_description": "3 years ago", "text": "The first impression of the lunches was positive, but then, as usual, the portions became smaller and the quality of the dishes worse, for example, the red fish disappeared from the fish soup.

You take a chicken kebab and expect a brisket, but what you get is a thigh, so it’s better to check in advance what you’ll be served.
