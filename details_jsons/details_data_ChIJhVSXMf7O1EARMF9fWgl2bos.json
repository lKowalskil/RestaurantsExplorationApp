Good advertising, nice young guys, quickly accepted the order and delivered it. I ordered 6 nuggets. We've bought them here a couple of times before, and they were very tasty! This time, instead of chicken meat, there was some strange mass inside. not even minced meat. I bit one, broke the second - the same disgusting thing. She asked for an explanation. The chef guy jumped out and reported. that it was not his fault that they put this... I said that I wouldn’t eat it, I asked for nuggets. Let's go call the authorities and have a meeting. They deliberated for about 1-15 minutes, then they said. what will be replaced. They asked me to wait. I waited for about 20 minutes, I even asked if they were catching a chicken for me? They answered that they were just asking what to do... Finally they gave me a bag of nuggets. I took it from above, broke it and: Oh miracle! It was the same real nugget. I took the bag and went to work, chewed the nugget as I went, walked halfway and took a bite of the second one. But this was already the same disgusting thing, and all the other unfortunate nuggets turned out to be the same. Moreover: there were four of them, that is, only five, they apparently took into account the one I had bitten and broken earlier. Apparently those “not bitten” ones of mine were simply heated in oil...You don’t see such rednecks very often! This is boorish redneck and fraud! The employees were clearly not rude, they behaved with professional restraint, they simply did not understand that I was fed up, because this is what they are supplied with, or else. that they are selling real bullshit to people is nothing (after all, they were told to sell it) I came back, didn’t demand money, bit into all these masterpieces (so that someone else wouldn’t get screwed over again) and created a scandal. So that there could be something like this in the center of Kyiv in Metrograd? SHAME!!G ANBA!!! We won't set foot there! At least not to get poisoned yet! In the end, I paid 45 UAH. I bought one nugget, lost 40 minutes and my mood was in the negative - I can’t describe it!

The cutlets in the burgers are made of who knows what, I don’t know the composition, and I don’t want to know, it’s more expensive for myself.\nThey are cold, apparently they contain bones from the wings, and what they didn’t eat - oops, a new portion of chicken nuggets! 😉👌\nLet's move on - French fries.. The best dish, but I can make this at home. Just pour oil and throw in potatoes and salt.\nThere is still juice from the good stuff. Oh yeah, the coffee is just terrible. I don't know what it is. It feels like it’s just half a bag of instant coffee for 2 ₴, and barely warm water.\nMy verdict is horror. Terrible.
