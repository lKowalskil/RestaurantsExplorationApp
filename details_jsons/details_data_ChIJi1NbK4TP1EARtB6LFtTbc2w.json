If you want to be in the thick of things, stay in the main hall with an open kitchen. As for food, we traditionally ordered breakfast for two. Hmmmm... The sparkling wine was brought in large glasses - a pleasant surprise. Poached eggs - Christmas tree sticks! Finally they learned how to make them without vinegar! Sugar - cane, beautiful new dishes and cutlery. Not frozen salmon, fresh herbs. I wanted to find at least one of the minuses - no, there are none! The staff does their best, the order was brought quickly, they did not forget to clear the plates, but were not intrusive.
