from Vyshnevo for the second time. Sushi is delicious. But delivery is just tin. Firstly, as I have already understood, it is impossible to place an order on the website. Ordered last time through the website with cash payment. They waited for the manager to call back, as was indicated. When no one answered in 15 minutes, we called ourselves. The first order arrived after 1:50. Although they say that delivery in 1:20 +-20 min.\nThis time I placed an order on the website and paid online. I didn't wait for a call back, but dialed right away to find out how to pay and how long my order would take. To which I was told \"we don't have online payment, it's just a standard site.\" Okay. But they didn't even have my order in their database, I placed it over the phone. They said again that the delivery will be in 1:20 +-20 minutes. As a result, after 1:40 I dialed the manager and asked when the order would be. \"The courier will be with you in 2 minutes.\" After 12 minutes, the courier called me and said that he would be there in a couple of minutes.\nIn general, the waiting time for the order is 2 hours. And no one himself calls and says about the delay.\nPlease do something about it. It is really very long. Or at least say the actual waiting time.\nThis delivery process really spoils the mood and impression\n\nP.S. And by the way, the manager did not hand over the entrance, apartment and floor to the courier. The courier asked to go outside because he only had a house listed.
