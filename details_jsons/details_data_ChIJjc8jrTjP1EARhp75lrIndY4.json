What's wrong: 1) the meatballs were not prepared at our place, but they were already cooked (that is, not from dust-heat as they say), at home they were barely warm (we live nearby, 5 minutes from the point); 2) all cutlets turned out to be dry. If it weren't for the fact that we ate them at home with a salad, it would have been impossible to eat them;\n!!!!! THIS is your MAIN dish and it barely makes it to the top three with a minus ????\n3) the amount of filling is very modest (only in the cutlet with cheddar, the ratio of the filling and the cutlet itself is ideal); 4) the size of the cutlets - they are not large (for example, it is larger in the same Puzatiya); 5) the price - in our subjective opinion, it is impossible to get enough of a cutlet or even two, that is, you need to take at least potatoes and sauce - it will come out under 300 hryvnias. For these funds, it is better to take a bomb saw on coal for 140 hryvnias.
