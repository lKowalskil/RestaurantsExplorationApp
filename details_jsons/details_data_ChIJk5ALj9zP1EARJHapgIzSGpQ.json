The table was located in the back between 2 bars and the WC. Can‚Äôt complain about that since I don‚Äôt like to sit near WC when I wanna enjoy a meal.\n\n- the waiter was polite and tried to explain and re Imane the dishes in English :) so we went for Egg Roti, Chicken Malaya, mango and papaya for starters.\n\n- the food, the presentation was well done, the tastes was sooooooo good with lot of flavours. I am used to asian food from around the world. But the chef did a good job üî•üî•\n\n- the price, for a breakfast/lunch for 2 people: 1000 UAH +10% tip I would say that the place is worth every UAH. for locals maybe a little expensive. Just saying.\n\n- finally, would I recommend this place: Yes definitely if they keep the same standard.üòãüòãüòã", "time": 1637409737, "translated": false}, {"author_name": "Erhan A", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109062577861741484625/reviews", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocJqamgZzxD8UY_FUr8TokabNxZc7eyw-TX1FKlDiuvUXg=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba3", "rating": 5, "relative_time_description": "2 years ago", "text": "Eastman is the best restaurant that we have been to so far in Kiev.

We normal leave restaurant quickly because our kids get bored but here they don't want to leave. They even have baby and mother friendly bathroom too. Their playground so safe for any age. They do have baby sitter as well so you can enjoy your bubbly... Our first waiter George and second visit waiter Roman was friendly and trained to deliver high standard of service. George was in control of their menu and could tell us exactly what we was ordering in English. Their butcher steak and their rice lager is a must.
