The prices are reasonable for a strip club..no rip offs in any way. All in all it's a great club, would definitely visit again.

Not only do they have many beautiful ladies, but they also have ladies who sing as part of the show.  These ladies are world class singers.  They should be in Hollywood recording music.  And their backup dancers are so beautiful I could not believe my eyes.  Just when you think you have seen the most beautiful woman, another one comes out and makes you adjust your scale.  A friendly staff will take care of you.  I came back when Darina was supposed to be working again to give her my bank account, but she was not there!  Oh the sadness!  I hope the singers have a you tube page.  They are so good.  And one backup dancer has the most beautiful eyes and smile I have ever seen.  Alas, no private dances from her.
