Previously, we ordered from sushi masters, the rolls arrived of the same quality, as well as the price - they were poor, but it was possible to eat. We called them for support, didn’t write bad reviews, thought that after the calls they would improve. But no. The last order just exhausted all my nerves. We paid through the website, no one called back to confirm the order. As a result, we were an hour and a half late, the administrator deceived us in the correspondence. We wanted to cancel the order; we had guests who could not wait 2.5 hours, but the administrator promised that they would deliver on time as an exception, since we are regular customers. As a result, they brought it even later. There were no rice chips in stock, so the courier brought a refund in cash, and when we counted it, there was 10 UAH missing. This is normal service! And although it’s not money, it’s not very nice. The sushi itself arrived sloppy, stuck together, and not completely cut. It's clear that they were in a hurry. It was impossible to tear the pieces away from each other without damaging them, the rolls fell apart on the sticks, the ratio of rice to fish can be seen in the photo. I don’t know which restaurant this order was made at, but this is the closest to our house, so we’re writing here. Guys, work on the service! This is no good. By the way, after writing to the support service there was no response.
