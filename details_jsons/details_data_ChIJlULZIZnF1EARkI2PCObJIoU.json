it. The smallest and cheapest shawarma costs UAH 130. For this money, I got a fresh taste of shawarma, no salt was added at all, as I thought. They didn't suggest taking it with you either, only a wet napkin and a toothpick. The shawarma was wrapped only in paper, without foil and a ball. There was only one more bag with napkins, but also paper. After starting to eat the shawarma, she began to untangle herself, and the wrap in which she was wrapped became wet and everything from the shawarma flowed on her hands and jacket. I didn't expect such horror... On the contrary, when you read that you go to an establishment called Shawarma Center, the taste and packaging will match the name. Don't go there anymore.\nI answer the questions of the owner of the establishment. I did not take salt with me, as I was not offered it. And there were only wet napkins and toothpicks, no other spices were offered. I wrote this above. I believe that if you do not salt the meat at all, as you answered me, then you should offer salt to taste. Agree, not everyone eats meat without salt. By the way, I forgot to write that the shawarma was barely warm, but I would have liked it hot.
