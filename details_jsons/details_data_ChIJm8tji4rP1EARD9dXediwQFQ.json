Now we will wait for changes, everyone has the right to make a mistake\n\nUPD\nAbout the cork fee - oh, was it a mistake? For some reason, I thought that this was a bonus for us through a check for 7,000 hryvnias. As a mistake - give us the card, of course we will pay. 350 hryvnias, if I'm not mistaken?\n\nWow, that's customer service! This is enthusiasm and charisma!\nIt's a pity that such a brave person hides behind the restaurant's account and does not write his name to us, such senseless guests). Good luck and development, the best professionals of the city)\n***\nHello, I had a wonderful dinner at your place, I have feedback:\n\n1. We were not charged a cork fee, we came with our own bottle of wine. It's nice of course! (our score was 7K+).\nIf you wish - you have a weak wine list, I wish there was no need to bring wine with you. It is very necessary for a professional to work, because the problem is directly :(\n\n2. Both octopuses, pizza, duck tartare were amazing!\n\n3. Steaks: tenderloin - soft, but not juicy, ribeye - juicy, but too tough, potatoes with steak pieces are mega tasty\n\n4. The dessert (chocolate fondant) is perfect!\n\n5. In the toilet, there is hand soap from a dispenser that dispenses unknown soap little by little... All good establishments are already so used to White Sprut or other Ukrainian aromatic brands, which speak of the establishment's status\n\n6. Cocktails are cool, but too strong and alcoholic - if you count on this, then there are no questions)\n\n7. The hangers in the hall are jammed, this is the feeling of a cafe, not a cool establishment. I would put them in the wardrobe\n\n8.
