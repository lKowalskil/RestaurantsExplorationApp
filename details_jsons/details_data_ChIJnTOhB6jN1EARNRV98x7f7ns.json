It’s simply scary to go into the restroom because the smell of urine there is terrible (despite the fact that there were two tables in the room!!!).\nMusic. No matter how you come, it’s the same thing every day.\nFood. About half of the menu is simply missing! Dishes in a stack. The prices listed on the menu do not match the prices on the receipt. Deep-fried dishes are very bitter - most likely the oil is not changed. Service. In Russian. No masks. It’s not a fact that the staff have health records.\nThe administrator/director (a bald, plump man) sometimes behaves inappropriately. Either he is calm and smiles stupidly, or he answers questions aggressively. The pupils are dilated. There is a smell of burnt leaves in the hall or near the kitchen (if you sit on the entrance).\nI definitely won't recommend this establishment.", "time": 1628508068, "translated": true}, {"author_name": "lvhd", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108688699520724829119/reviews", "language": "en-US", "original_language": "ru", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjXI5F-NIQ5yWf6KMuz64K5u7aFWJzejF7Lw9Ea9t3hLTQg=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba3", "rating": 5, "relative_time_description": "3 years ago", "text": "We went to this place last night to celebrate a birthday.

We didn’t arrive at the beginning of the celebration, so the entire range of ordered dishes was already on the table. Everything had cooled down and was cold. Of course, everything looked nice, but alas, it didn’t taste good. The steak, most likely medium rare, looked like sole and tasted about the same. Apparently it is not customary in the establishment to reheat, or you have to ask for it. Which is quite strange.\nThere were children at the party. Which over time began to run and make noise. To which the staff reacted very strangely, offering to seat us. Or not to leave the rented hall (by the way, the hall has no doors and it was not possible to keep a two-year-old child in a hall without doors without provoking hysterics). But alas, the administration didn’t care. The conversation was in a rude manner. The guy, most likely an administrator, at some point just started yelling and saying that his children sit down on command. If they don’t sit down, he doesn’t take them with him🤨\nWe just left. In a terrible mood. So as not to spoil the holiday for the remaining guests and not to create meaningless scandals that lead to nothing. Thus, without bothering the staff with children.\nThe conclusion is this: the establishment is not designed for children (or negotiate for a distant room that is more or less closed), if the staff doesn’t like something, then don’t expect politeness, if you don’t come at the beginning of the celebration, then be prepared for ice-cold dishes. If your children do not sit down on command, it is better not to come here.\nYou can drink beer and watch football, or go to dinner in this establishment, it will be comfortable, but the service for celebrations is disgusting.", "time": 1574704591, "translated": true}], "serves_beer": true, "serves_dinner": true, "serves_lunch": true, "serves_wine": true, "takeout": true, "types": ["restaurant", "cafe", "bar", "food", "point_of_interest", "establishment"], "url": "https://maps.google.com/?cid=8930320435149346101", "user_ratings_total": 33, "utc_offset": 120, "vicinity": "Mezhova Street, 24, Kyiv"}, "status": "OK"}
