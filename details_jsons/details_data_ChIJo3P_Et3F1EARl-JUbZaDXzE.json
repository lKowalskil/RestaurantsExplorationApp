MAF, there is new equipment, and few people know what they are doing here. We were very happy when we noticed on the map that there was finally a place near the megacity to buy shawarma and not have to go to Leningrad Square, but - the guy who was cooking was without a mask (we didn't notice if there were gloves), there wasn't much meat on the grill , and therefore there is hope that it is fresh, the cabbage was taken from the refrigerator. The shawarma lacks Korean carrots, too much cabbage and only one piece of pickle (we ordered a mini, but still one small piece is not enough!!). It was very infuriating that it was barely, barely warm, not warmed up inside at all and was more or less warm only because of the chicken. But these are all small things, when I started eating I noticed that the lavash had a strange taste, after which I paid attention to the mold on the lavash!!!! Everything was fine with the boy, but one part of mine was moldy - it's sad. It's hard to see in the photo, but I hope you can understand. I would like to give more stars and write a positive review, but the fact that not all the basic products were cold, they cooked without a mask, and I was lucky enough to get moldy lavash played the fact of one star (Very upset by the first impression)", "time": 1597078915, "translated": true}, {"author_name": "–û–ª–µ–∫—Å–∞–Ω–¥—Ä –ö–æ–≤–∞–ª—å—á—É–∫", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115488296196095879169/reviews", "language": "en-US", "original_language": "uk", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjV9SQ2NOTDNsuYTevvQaG5-CY8EwqD0tikRcUFMGCLZg-4=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo", "rating": 1, "relative_time_description": "3 years ago", "text": "Rating for shawarma.
