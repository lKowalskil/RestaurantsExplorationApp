come here. I love the food. It’s great value for money however\nI came here on the 16th of may with a friend at around 10 pm and ordered this dish and another. I had a young ukranian waiter (male) who messed up my order and brought a single piece of chicken for 125 grvs instead of this for 250. The waiter didn’t understand English well so on complaining he called his manager (who was Arabic and his name was Muhammad Shidee-щиди) we told him the order was incorrect so he brought us the same chicken with plain rice and a bowl of yoghurt when we told him it’s not the same thing as the menu picture he went and got the rice fried and tried to convince us it’s the same thing (as a regular we know it’s not). On complaining he told us to be quite and was being super rude about how we wasted his time and if we don’t want to pay we should just eat and go. As customers he had no right to use this language. He misbehaved so much, ruined our mood and we couldn’t enjoy our dinner anymore. After we asked for cheque we still paid for the dish that was not according to our liking. He kept coming to our table to fight, afterwards the other staff apologized on his behalf but the damage is done. The food is good but they should fire their useless staff. As Muslim I want to visit a halal restaurant and this is one of the good options but this disgusting behavior of disrespecting customers will not be tolerated. As you can see in picture food not as shown. Very disappointed. And also they reduced their quantity or maybe they only respect Arabic and ukranian customers as I saw that day. Very racist. I don’t recommend anymore. I’m very upset.", "time": 1621630930, "translated": false}, {"author_name": "Sanjay Khan", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100818046711093246497/reviews", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjUvUT--d1A2_KdEyVBmmVyu-j7FEzRczHPRUFDQbPvbJfY=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba3", "rating": 5, "relative_time_description": "2 years ago", "text": "This is one of the best middle eastern cuisine you could ever have in Kiev.
