Paid 800uah for a standard room (I think. Can't really remember the name of the room). The receptionist could speak English and that was cool. They also usually ask for a form of identity. Their cafe is usually open 24/7 and you get a 10 percent discount if u are a new customer. My room had no windows and was kind of small but not claustrophobic. The room had a fan and tv. The bathroom and toilet were clean. If you do not have slippers, you could buy from the receptionist but at a fee. If u plan on using the slippers to have ur bath keep in mind that it does retain water. I had to spread a towel on the floor so as to prevent leaving my footsteps all over. I ordered the spicy chicken with rice and it was very good. Their food was palatable and tasted really good. They have a luggage storage room where u can keep your load for 24hours in case u have something to do in town and don't want to have to pay for an extra night because check out time is 12pm. You can check in anytime tho. So generally, I will recommend this place especially if u aren't staying for long and just need a quick place to sleep and continue your journey.
