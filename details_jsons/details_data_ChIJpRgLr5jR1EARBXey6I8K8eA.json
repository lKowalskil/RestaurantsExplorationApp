more for the management/owners of the network, and not a slur on a specific institution, I will describe today's day to understand what prompted me to this:\n1) the table reservation was made on 29.02 on 09.03, where it was emphasized that we can choose any table, because there is no reservation yet, the table was chosen, but unfortunately, when we arrived, our table was occupied by some kind of banquet. (to be fair: the administrator, who was available at the time at the establishment, offered us compensation in the form of a discount on cork free, and dessert (as gifts), and after the banquet left, the waiter offered to take the table we reserved, the situation was resolved on place, but I would like to be warned about such permutations in the future)\n2) I'm just begging the management of the chain, give this establishment more dishes, I felt very sorry for the waiter and the administrator, who kept apologizing for the fact that they had to serve dishes in the wrong dishes.\n3) I am asking the management very much, this establishment has 5-7 tables on 9/03 there were 3 banquets, one table was booked by us, another was booked by other visitors, we came at 6:00 p.m., when we made the order, half of the dishes were already gone availability, so this is my request to the management, provide the facility with more products.\nThere were some other moments, but considering that today was sold out, we will make a discount for it.\nIn summary, we have been with you for several months as regular visitors, either in the institution (not only here), or for self-delivery, today:\n1) The food is delicious, even taking into account the full house (there was a little jam with potatoes (some of them were overfried) and lyula kebab (the wrong one was prepared), but it was tasty and fast).\n2) Service, the girls did everything they could at that time (honor and praise)\n3) The atmosphere, to be honest, was not very good, the parents said that they would not come again, unfortunately.\nThis feedback is directed to the management, not once do I want to punish the staff who worked today, they did their best, thank you.", "time": 1710018610, "translated": true}, {"author_name": "Наталья Савостьяненко", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106788076375846393728/reviews", "language": "en-US", "original_language": "uk", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocIlaQ1QzvM_lKDi2Et_586izXlF7h_xU6T9J9wayEDq=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo", "rating": 4, "relative_time_description": "4 months ago", "text": "I liked it, slightly overpriced for the grill considering the location.
