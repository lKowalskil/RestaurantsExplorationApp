order for the new year. Before that, I took it with the understanding that it was far from \"Sushi\", but it was just sushi that was close to the house and relatively (the key is relatively, because you would never call them elite) they were nothing like that, because, after all, the fish was always put in a thin piece and the sushi itself did not look aesthetically pleasing, although sometimes it was tasty. But when I made an early order for the new year, the day before the celebration, for some reason I chose them among all the sushi bars (now I'm really surprised and don't understand why?!), I expected that people would try. I wanted for later, but the last order is for 19:30, well, I understand - everyone wants to go home, but they brought it not at 19:30, but at 18:45, but ok: again, I still understand this - the New Year is just around the corner. Let's go back to the sushi itself: this is a festive order! And, God, what a blessing that we celebrated only as a family, because on the festive table, if there were also guests, it would be just a shame to put \"such\" on the table. Firstly, I feel that I paid 70% for the rice, secondly, everything was twisted very quickly, as if someone had shaken it in boxes (perhaps it was, but the fish was cut crookedly, somewhere it did not cover the pieces of rice at all), in addition everything was falling apart: I had to eat it with a spoon (I'm not kidding). Well, I make a discount on the fact that this was most likely the last order, but this does not justify them - fish with a piece of tuna, I am completely silent about the eel, it is like a dried transparent piece that was already almost crunchy ü´£ I just really hoped to get pleasure, but a very unpleasant impression remained. After no foot there. They took it for UAH 1000, I would have preferred to buy fish and rice separately üòÖ it's very unpleasant, although it's my own fault, because before that I understood that the price-quality ratio was appropriate here, but after the last order I realized that the price was even overstated. The establishment had to understand that this would most likely be put on the table and would they put such a thing in front of their friends? The taste is dry, there is a lot of rice, everything falls apart, the fish is almost not noticeable at all. Imagine that it was a holiday order, then what is served on an ordinary day. On this day, my eyes were opened to this institution. Although, the administrator girl or whoever takes the order there is always very friendly, but if only the business was built on this. Disappointed, unfortunately.
