From the first minute of the procedure, it turned out that the curling irons were damaged due to the fact (as the master explained) that no one had done the curling for a long time, i.e. - from old age. The master asked me to help her in the process, namely, to place each curler in her hand. Well ok, I thought. At the end of the process, it became obvious that the perm did not work out. I expected that there might be deviations from the desired result, but not by that much. They immediately began to convince me that everything was fine, that this was how it should be. That there is nothing wrong with this and you need to shorten the length, because the length straightens the curls. I still insisted that my hair be kept in the composition a little longer, which caused the curls to curl. At the end, the master did my hair and I went home.\nBottom line. When you wash your hair for the first time, the blow-dry is washed away and your hair looks damaged and unkempt. Terrible hair loss began, as if I had undergone chemotherapy. They cut my hair in half (so that the curl would curl). There are no curls, no length. Hair is in poor condition.\nAll this for 200 US.\nI do not undertake to judge all employees, but I got the impression of extreme incompetence. Maybe the haircut in the salon is not bad (for adult Kiev ladies who like it richly), but it would still be a good idea for the hairdressers to attend advanced training courses, get an education abroad, for example, and moderate their pathos a little.\nAddition.\n\nA nice, sweet girl called back and inquired about the condition of my hair. After listening carefully, she was inspired and promised to do something. After a while I called back again. The tone was just as sweet, but according to her, it turned out that I simply did not understand how to properly care for my hair, style it and use a diffuser. “Come and the master will show you how to style your hair,” and she also offered skincare treatments at a “discount.” From all that she said, it became clear that they consider the client to be an idiot who does not know how to hold a comb in his hand and that they can also make money from this by selling restorative procedures. I explain that there is little hair left and that there is nothing to style. But she was relentless.\nRedneck place, collective farm staff, abusive attitude towards the client.", "time": 1607841901, "translated": true}, {"author_name": "Polina Novikova", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100728952538700402512/reviews", "language": "en-US", "original_language": "uk", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjU8WD6dxwvJvGvW2vP6H-b6DH8OY5gRxPHnUlqPEg545HCM=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba5", "rating": 4, "relative_time_description": "2 years ago", "text": "I really like the design and the friendliness of the staff.
