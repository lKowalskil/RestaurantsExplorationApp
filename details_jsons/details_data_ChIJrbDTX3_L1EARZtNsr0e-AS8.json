My husband is an expert on napoleons, he has already tasted them everywhere, and he rated this one a 5+. My cheese was also very, very, moderately sweet, fresh, fragrant... Cocoa is not the tastiest that I drank, that's honest, but I can't say that it was bad. A very nice consultant girl. The only downside, in my opinion, is the room itself. Due to the fact that it is a basement, there is very little air. Maybe it seemed that way to me because they came in wearing masks. Therefore, they ate their desserts outside. There is only one small table, but it was quite cozy. In the evening, there were no people, no cars, we had fun... I will not remove points for the specified nuances. And, by the way, someone wrote that the prices are not cheap in comparison... O_o In my opinion, it's a whole lot for Kyiv. We ate two desserts and drank two drinks for UAH 140, while quite recently, in another establishment, I only tasted one dessert for UAH 100.\nI wish you success and prosperity.\n\n23.07.2020\nUnfortunately, I had to add to my review and lower the score. In the last week, we visited the pastry shop several more times. All the cakes were wonderful - nut, cold cheese, Pavlova, carrot... (In the corresponding section there is a photo-confirmation of all these visits). But then we decided to try the pastries (not at a good time, so to speak) and it was a real disappointment. The donuts I bought yesterday are stuffed, the dough is very dense, even the filling did not save them... but oh well. Tried the cinnamon today... You have no idea how I waited for them... all day... with real trepidation and in awe because I just love these cinnamon rolls... saw them in the window yesterday but decided to stop at the donuts, went back for the cinnamon buns today... and you know what?.. It looks like the same cinnamon buns I was looking at in the window yesterday, they sold me. The dough is frankly stale. To say that I am outraged is to say nothing. The mood is spoiled for the whole evening. Honestly. Yes, it is not expensive to kill for it... But the fact itself is the relationship with the customer. All bakeries , who respect themselves, even if they display yesterday's products, they make huge discounts and warn about it. A person has the right to choose for himself - to pay the full price and eat fresh, or to save money. Here, apparently, the approach is somewhat different. I feel deceived. I put 5 stars and you have a dry bun... Now there will be 3 stars. And I don't want to come back anymore.
