This is simply the worst thing I've ever tried from all fast food, in particular from shawarma. I won’t be lazy, I’ll throw another 55 UAH on your wretchedness with chicken and take a photo and attach it here to the review, but I won’t even feed the shawarma (if you can call it that) to the dogs. Look for problems in yourself, starting with technological maps, because someone came up with this vomit combination of ingredients, ending with an employee at the TT (outlet). Oh yes, advice, in shawarma with chicken - there should be chicken, and not a teaspoon of tasteless pate, after trying it, I couldn’t even tell what it was made of. Don't fool people. Either you need to redo everything completely (in your case it’s unlikely to help, since you allowed something like this to be discovered), or shut up and DON’T FOOL PEOPLE!!! If you answer, I can bombard your misery in more detail. It’s a pity I’ll have to give you one star instead of zero or put you in the minus. Point on Heroes of Sevastopol near the bus stop, opposite the children's library. The seller (woman) is charming, with a face: as if I had come to her house and asked her to feed me.
