Yesterday, after a wonderful sauna, no matter how much I wanted to, I had to go “like” to a business meeting. The meeting was scheduled at the cafe \"La Farine bakery\". As a serious and punctual person, I arrived much earlier and did not regret it later. Entering the cafe, the gently pleasant smell of baked goods knocked me out. Since I had plenty of time, I decided to drink coffee and look at the menu. After “walking” through the menu, I realized that I was in the right place at the right time. After a call from the “business people” regarding the meeting, the meeting was rescheduled. Well, great. So it was time for dinner, so I started ordering. Ordered a salad with seafood, Steak Osobukooo.\nThe delivery of the order was excellent!!! The steak just melted in your mouth, complemented by barbecue sauce and homemade crusty bread, as it turns out they bake it themselves. The only downside is that I visited this wonderful cafe on my own, without my beloved! Well, of course, he was driving. The staff is friendly, the atmosphere is great. Beautiful figurines made of bronze. Keep it up!!! I will definitely come again, just not for a meeting, but with my beloved wife.\nP.S. I took with me a couple of pieces of cakes and croissants, which they prepare themselves, all culturally put in their branded boxes \"La Farine bakery\" I will definitely come again!!!", "time": 1709818132, "translated": true}, {"author_name": "Светалана Ивановна", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108590569153661652945/reviews", "language": "en-US", "original_language": "uk", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocJeLtnl7VNi3bmq9JrP9FoYddnSu-hLJ2M7skNEEMYy=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo", "rating": 5, "relative_time_description": "a week ago", "text": "I have repeatedly visited this cozy cafe, in which I like everything: interior, atmosphere, cuisine.
