impressions! On March 2, 2024, we celebrated our daughter‚Äôs first birthday. We wanted everything to be perfect, but alas... The devil pulled us to order a banquet at this establishment! The menu was discussed in advance with the manager and for 11 people it came out to almost 10 thousand 400 UAH.\nWe agreed to bring alcohol, water, bread and cake with us. Now the name day has come... We arrive 20-25 minutes before the appointed time (we were allowed), while we walked around and took pictures - it‚Äôs already 16.30.\nThe table was booked for 16.00, and at 16.30 the table was practically empty! There were 0 napkins! Spices, toothpicks - 0! There is very little food! I understand that they take it out gradually, but it was mega-gradual! The waitress brought something out every 40-50 minutes! I didn‚Äôt take the ‚Äúgarbage‚Äù from the table! Our grandmothers have already gotten used to preparing empty plates in advance to give to her. There was essentially nothing to eat! Excuse me, ordering for that amount and remaining hungry is nonsense! That's not all! After 20 minutes of the feast, we realized that we were in complete silence! One of the grandmothers went to find out what was wrong with the music, to which she was told that she needed to rent a speaker! What else is this?! There was background music playing in the regular hall, but not in our separate hall! Deathly silence! As a result, we go and rent a water dispenser (500 UAH!) I was also surprised by one interesting fact - when discussing with the manager, we included compote (5 liters) and juice (2 liters) in the menu. I didn‚Äôt find any juice on the table! I went and told the waitress to bring it, to which she said - juice is not included in the menu! I asked my husband and he also remembers about the juice! As a result, we ordered juice again - 2 liters.\nWe ordered 1 tea, 1 coffee and 2 cocoa for the cake and in the end the total bill came out to the amount of 11 thousand 713 UAH. We were robbed as they wanted! They left hungry and angry! Money down the drain! This feast was not worth that kind of money! The holiday is ruined!
