The quality is stable, the same variety tastes the same every time. Usually the coffee is really tasty. Once, I ordered 2 packs of coffee as a gift for friends, wrote \"grind under a dzhezva\" and 2 packs of beans for myself. 4 packages of ground coffee arrived. I contacted them and on the same day they sent me 2 packs of grains for replacement. They also left me some ground coffee by accident.\nThere was also a negative experience: one of the varieties (Ethiopia 11) was very bitter in espresso, although the description of the coffee is \"sweet, apricot, cocoa\". I tried to change the grind, water, and temperature, then I saw that there were too many light beans in the coffee, either Quakers (light coffee beans that were harvested unripe, add bitterness and flatness to the drink), or simply under-roasted. Quakers rather, because the coffee prepared separately from them did not even have a hint of acid. I selected 10% of them (in the photo, for comparison, coffee from the same pack). In response, they wrote to me: \"And what did you want from coffee for 400 hryvnias/kg? It's grade 5, but the main thing is not the color, but the taste.\" Taste. In coffee, where there is a 10% defect, yes. For understanding: in Ethiopia, grades 7-9 are not allowed to be exported at all.

I decided why not to bother in direct, but to issue it through a chatbot. The promo code does not work there, it only works on the website. Why it is technically so difficult to do this in a chatbot, I do not know. I went to the direct mail for processing, everything was processed for me, but again, the plate is without a promo code. I don't see any difficulties at all in placing an order with a discount in direct. In the end, they sent me to the site and poked their noses that it was my fault, that I was told twice about the site, and I got here in direct mail.
