Ali can find an approach to every child, he teaches the children not only the correct blows/techniques, but and makes you think, think. The training is interesting and intense. If before classes at the MMA school we had problems in kindergarten and first grade with self-defense from more aggressive and physical. prepared children, then there is no such problem now. The son has become more physically developed/hardier/stronger and is not afraid, already using acquired skills and techniques, to fight back even “fighters” who are older in age and height. During training, the coach combines both rigor and the ability to support with a kind word, praise, joke, and tell an instructive incident from his own life.
