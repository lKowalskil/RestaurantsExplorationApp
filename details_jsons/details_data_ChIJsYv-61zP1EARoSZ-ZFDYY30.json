It is not the first time that my colleagues and I have encountered the fact that they are either punched incorrectly (the check contains a different product, similar in name, but more expensive) or weighed.\nFor example, I once bought a banana cookie, the cost of which should be about 40 UAH, I receive a check from the seller and see that the amount in the check is more than 100 UAH (I paid by card and somehow at the machine, because I already know approximately how much it will cost, I did not immediately pay attention to the amount ), and then I read the check - BANANA CAKE.\nThe sales girl, must have been new, didn't even know how to do a refund, so she just refunded the difference with her own funds.\n\nToday the situation happened again.\nA colleague punched the wrong product and incorrectly gave the rest.\nWhen I was buying honeydew (a piece of 100 grams), I found 300 grams in the receipt, and of course the amount was much larger than expected.\nAs soon as we returned to sort things out, the seller immediately replied that she had made a mistake and would now try to make it right.\nAnd although the situation was resolved by refunding money, it left unpleasant memories about this institution. After all, this is far from the first time, and I and my colleagues have encountered this. We went there because it was close and in principle the products were to our liking, but now the desire to buy anything there has disappeared.", "time": 1687421075, "translated": true}, {"author_name": "Maryna Derkach", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104081078439338289175/reviews", "language": "en-US", "original_language": "uk", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocJyygU_Lops6wwO4DUNf4FrcjOq6L8DCJFm2v-Khc2a=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba4", "rating": 1, "relative_time_description": "2 years ago", "text": "A very unpleasant seller, with a \"dissatisfied\" face.
