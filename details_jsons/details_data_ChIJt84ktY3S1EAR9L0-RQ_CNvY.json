Arriving at the self-service checkout and starting to scan the products, I noticed that the price tag for a set of razors is significantly different from the price tag on the counter. I asked the representative of the store nearby to find out the reason why the price at the register was not at all the same as the price tag on the product. The employee of the store immediately went to the rack with razors and immediately pulled out the price tag, and also contemptuously and mockingly began to conduct a dialogue, saying that they forgot to replace it and whether I will buy the product according to the price tag on the cash register. I asked this employee to call the manager of the store, to which she replied that the manager was on vacation and she was the deputy manager. I wanted to buy the product according to the price tag that was indicated on the shelf, to which I received the answer \"why should I give my money\", I replied that I do not need the employee's \"money\" at all, at the same time, I need the product at the price indicated on price tag, the dialogue continued for about 2 minutes in approximately this direction. The assistant manager of the store once again turned around honorably and rudely, and left with the words \"I will now bring and give my money.\" I put all the goods on the nearest shelf and left without waiting for the \"deputy store manager\". Since that moment, I have not returned to this store and do not intend to return.\nP.S. In this store, price tag inconsistencies were encountered quite often, both from my side and from the side of other visitors to the store (I was a witness).\nAppeal to the \"Fora\" network:\n1. Teach employees how to communicate with people, as well as how to communicate in the store in the state language, as required by current legislation.\n2. Monitor the compliance of price tags and the quality of customer service in the store.\n3. Pay more attention to the personnel policy of the store.\n//////\nI DO NOT RECOMMEND the store, because in addition to the rude attitude of the staff, \"irrelevant\" price tags, spoiled mood, you, as a person carrying money to this store, will not get anything.
