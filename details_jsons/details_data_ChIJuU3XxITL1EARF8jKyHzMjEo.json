It is clear that the owners paid attention to the appearance of the fitness club.\nFor me, a big advantage is that the hall is open from 7:00. So I manage to do a 30-minute run on the treadmill before work (according to the doctor's recommendation). Just enough time for training and a shower.\nBut in the hall from the morning something is constantly happening. There is no water in the shower - it's cool to learn about it after a 30-minute run. For some reason, you can't use the treadmills - there seems to be no electricity, and they are probably under a lot of stress. Although the music is so loud that you can hear it on the street, the coffee is made without any problems. This, in my opinion, is a somewhat strange distribution of priorities for a fitness club. And the problem is not even that there are problems with water or electricity - questions to the employees who meet you and give you the keys to the drawers. Is it not possible to warn that there is no water or that some simulators are not working? Why is it always a surprise? Why can't you take the client's card BEFORE TRAINING and say \"Sorry, but we have an unforeseen situation.
