the shawarma shop “Shaurma.ua” in Kyiv, and I want to share my impressions with you.\n\n**Shawarma structure**\n\nOverall, the texture of the shawarma was not bad. The pita was soft and juicy, and the pita was crispy and not dry. However, I wish the pita bread was a little thinner so that the filling would be more evenly distributed.\n\n**Filling**\n\nThe filling in the shawarma was simply amazing. The meat was juicy and flavorful, the vegetables were fresh and crisp, and the sauce was perfectly balanced. I especially liked that the shawarma had a lot of meat and vegetables.\n\n**Taking the first sample**\n\nThe first taste of shawarma was simply amazing. The meat was melt in your mouth, the vegetables were fresh and crispy and the sauce was delicious. I immediately felt that this was one of the best shawarmas I have ever tried.\n\n**Remainder**\n\nI ate the rest of the shawarma at home and it was also very tasty. The pita was a little soft but still juicy. The meat and vegetables were still fresh and tasty.\n\n**Grand total**\n\nOverall, I was very pleased with the shawarma from the Shawarma.ua shawarma shop. This is one of the best shawarmas I've ever tried. I will definitely go back there again.\n\n**Additional comments**\n\nHere are a few additional comments I'd like to add:\n\n* Shawarma was very filling. I ate almost all of it, and even after that I felt full.\n* The shawarma shop staff were very welcoming and friendly.\n* The atmosphere in the shawarma shop was cozy and inviting.\n\n**Recommendations**\n\nI recommend all shawarma lovers to visit the shawarma shop “Shaurma.ua”.
