I would hate to see a place like this close because of service and stupidity.\n\n12.12.20 Saturday at 14:40\nI visited the establishment with my girlfriend for the first time. We were pleasantly surprised by the interior.\nThe establishment is excellent, the style, interior, renovation, everything is at the highest level, you want to return to such a place, you want to drink coffee here, and not take it with you.\n\nBut when it came to ordering, all these thoughts faded into the background. We came for the capuorange drink. There was a guy behind the bar who couldn’t put two words together, literally couldn’t. When asked about the capoorange, he stuttered and couldn’t answer, he said I don’t know and looked for someone behind our back and said the girl would come and do everything. We saw capuorange on the menu (he didn’t offer a menu either, it was on the counter) and waited for the girl. Soon a girl came up (the girl’s appearance was also not neat) and said, we don’t have any oranges, I can’t make capuorange (2 o’clock in the afternoon, there are no oranges in the coffee shop). However, she did not offer anything in return and ended the conversation there. Next, we asked for a latte and I waited for the drink, and the girl went to the restroom. By the way, the showcase was half empty, nothing was offered for coffee.\n\nBefore she went into the restroom, a guy came out who couldn’t put two words together. The restroom was very dirty, can’t the person who works there see it himself?\n\nLatte was ok. It’s a shame when the owner has invested so much effort into the establishment, and it can pay off by ordering the same coffee and food from the window, and the staff does nothing to make customers want to return to this place, just like the cash register.", "time": 1607873150, "translated": true}], "serves_breakfast": true, "takeout": true, "types": ["cafe", "food", "store", "point_of_interest", "establishment"], "url": "https://maps.google.com/?cid=3039675908498341152", "user_ratings_total": 1, "utc_offset": 120, "vicinity": "Rusanivska Embankment, 8, Kyiv", "website": "https://www.crema-caffe.biz/"}, "status": "OK"}
