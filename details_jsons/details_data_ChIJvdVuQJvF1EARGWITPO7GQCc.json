restaurateurs, critics. I don't know what made you come to this review, but I'm glad to share my story with you. One rainy evening, I decided to check out an establishment that is not far from my house. I looked at this work of art for a long time, did not dare to go in, decided to wait to really enjoy the atmosphere: \"You need a clear mind, a good night's sleep\" - I thought and decided to visit in the evening.\nHaving entered and smelled the smell of the establishment itself, without hesitation, a picture of some kind of roadside pub, old, smoked, flashed before my eyes. Honestly, I was interested in how they cook here, I thought, maybe the first impression is wrong. Having sat down at the table (I made a reservation for the front, but there is no excitement there, so you can not call), after looking at the menu, I decided to order pasta (they said that it is prepared here by their own hands) with TRUFFLE butter, God forgive me, kebab (cooked, as they say, on coals ), and salad.\nThe pasta looked as if I had prepared it in the dormitory. A ton of oil (it didn't even smell close to truffle), fried mushrooms, chopped hastily, fried onions and the pasta itself. To the taste... Have you ever tasted oil from under a frying pan? Somewhere it tastes like this and it's soooo fat. This pasta costs 280 hryvnias, not 180. If it were cheaper, there are no questions. Although I'm lying, there would still be questions. I think the meat will be tastier, probably. Serving meat 5 cartilages out of 5 - I liked it. But the meat itself was cooked, most likely, on an electric grill. Pickled onions are delicious. The prices are higher than the delicious average cuisine, but the cuisine itself is a big mess... Oh, and the tea was also tasty and not too fatty. Dishes with drops and divorces. The toilet is dirty, but there is a plus - a shelf with literature for reading. However, the library is available only in the men's restroom, there is no literature in the women's restroom, and, in fact, there is no lock in the toilet. The staff complains that it can be heard in the hall. In a word, I didn't like it. I do not judge, each person has his own taste. And my taste was very greasy from the oil. He did not finish the portions. I will not return here. Let him continue to stand, waiting for his customers. I advise you to taste that pasta, you will understand me. good luck", "time": 1709296555, "translated": true}, {"author_name": "Павел Павлов", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100604864839606265726/reviews", "language": "en-US", "original_language": "uk", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocJDJivgyTcKx3aggonTNt-RkcxrpD8U0uTC5fyrbl5N=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo", "rating": 5, "relative_time_description": "2 months ago", "text": "Today, I visited Pizza&Pasta Trattoria with my wife on Dniprovska naberezhnaya, 2-B.
