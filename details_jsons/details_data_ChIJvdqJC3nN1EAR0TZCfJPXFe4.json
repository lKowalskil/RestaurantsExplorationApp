The first thing I saw: two baristas sitting and smoking DURING WORKING TIME AT A TABLE FOR VISITORS. I hoped with all my heart that these two were not the people who would make my coffee. Also sitting next to them was a citizen who looked very suspicious: apparently with a hangover, well, we don‚Äôt blame you.\nI made an order, turning to the barista who was behind the counter (she, by the way, was not very tidy either) and after that, Hallelujah, I hoped that they would start making my order. But it was not there! Two baristas, who until that moment had been smoking near the cafe (thankfully, at least not inside), floated phlegmatically behind the bar counter. I closely watched how these citizens would prepare coffee for me. But, as the investigation found out, the buyer‚Äôs order is not a PRIORITY for them: one of the baristas, literally poking a cup and syrup in my face, began to prepare HERSELF COFFEE, calmly looking at me (ala everything is in order, don‚Äôt drift). Well, I thought, of course, I‚Äôm not in a hurry at 8 am on Friday, despite the fact that I‚Äôm going to work on the other side of the city. Next, these members of the cult of terrible coffee (sorry, spoiler) began - hurray - to prepare my coffee! But our adventures do not end there, they only continue! The baristas didn‚Äôt even think about wearing gloves and masks - I‚Äôm not hinting at anything, but we have a quarantine in our country + a catering establishment. I asked the girl from whom I placed an order that her colleagues would put on protective equipment. Reluctantly, and with the air of a huge favor, the baristas nevertheless put on masks.\n‚ÄúThis girl just smoked, and now she‚Äôs making my coffee,‚Äù I said, after which the lady reluctantly pulled on her gloves (not she personally, but another friend gave them to her)\nIn general, we got to coffee. The process begins, a couple of minutes, and voila, the coffee is ready! But while all this was happening, the barista‚Äôs girlfriends were constantly laughing loudly, and the third barista was changing clothes behind the counter (lol).\nFinally they gave me coffee - I ordered 300 milliliters, but they handed me a proud half-liter. After tasting this drink, I felt - attention - the taste of detergent in coffee! In addition, the dose of coffee was calculated for 300 ml, and they added ordinary water to increase it to 500, because of this the taste of the coffee became very bland. I don‚Äôt know what they‚Äôre doing there in their office, but I‚Äôll never set foot there again!\nPeSe: I poured out the coffee without even drinking a tenth of it.", "time": 1632039947, "translated": true}, {"author_name": "–ú—ñ—à–∞ –°—ñ–≤–∞—á–µ–Ω–∫–æ", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111097143847438412483/reviews", "language": "en-US", "original_language": "uk", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjWIDWpHY1XJef5gw3_tojpTeLcaHU4gyM6Xf6uIArsC-g=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba3", "rating": 5, "relative_time_description": "2 years ago", "text": "Everything is great, very cool.
