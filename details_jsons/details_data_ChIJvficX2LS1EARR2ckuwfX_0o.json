name a yacht, so it will float,” and this maxim contains a rather deep meaning. Montserrat is a mountain with a unique energy. And the Montserrat cafe is also a place with a unique energy! Despite the fact that it is located on the first floor of the Smart Plaza Polytech shopping center, you find yourself in another dimension and this energy of the place begins to work! The interior hints to guests that they have nowhere to rush. It seems that time has stopped here so that visitors can enjoy coffee and delicious pastries. Wooden trays, stylish multi-colored cups, always positive staff, all this together creates this unique atmosphere. The concept of the establishment is simple and at the same time unusual: you find yourself in a space where nothing will distract you. And gourmets can treat themselves to a unique product - Japanese mochi ice cream! This is one of the few places where they make coffee with natural whipped cream. Also, a nice bonus program for regular customers, every sixth coffee is free! The pricing policy is very moderate. And so, sitting on a soft scarlet sofa, you relax with delicious and aromatic coffee! After all, a feeling of comfort is necessary for every person. Thank you for your invaluable work, which contributed to recreating the unique energy of this place, and the professionalism of your employees, who pamper their customers with a variety of dishes and drinks of the highest quality!", "time": 1639495140, "translated": true}, {"author_name": "Alex Delsian", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101108149194374388848/reviews", "language": "en-US", "original_language": "ru", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjW1qv_T1nu6shSnHG0y3eBpAWoSpGxLiiqIHEFyJnOMIZQr=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba8", "rating": 4, "relative_time_description": "5 years ago", "text": "Café Montserrat is ideally located in the new shopping center right in the center of the spacious corridor leading from the entrance to the supermarket. People, like working ants, walk in a continuous stream in all directions and, of course, many make a pit stop for coffee.\n\nA bright red shiny island, like a long-awaited land in a huge ocean or an oasis in the desert... although no, I recently made such a comparison in another review. And this is not a desert. Nearby is the Coffee House, up the escalator there are two more coffee shops. Everything is aloof and not so brightly attractive. You don’t want to go through it, especially if you are looking for #wheretocoffee, if you have the desire, but the coffee is there, nearby and served with a smile.\n\nThe visual style of Montserrat is perfect, the choice of desserts is extensive, the staff is fast and active, you can talk, joke, smile - everything works out. There are cups, and they are also not simple and elegant (you can’t drink coffee from a paper cup, which promises to be a pleasure).\n\nIn general, the expectations are the highest. Yes, yes, don’t say it, I’ve known for a long time that living with expectations is a mistake! But all the signs are there. You wait with pleasure. Relaxed.\n\nAlthough no, I was immediately alarmed by the answer to the question about the type of coffee used. I'm not a big expert, but I always ask to keep the conversation going.\n\nThey said: pure Arabica, a blend of eight (!) varieties... Eight varieties? Interesting. If this is such a gourmet blend, where the varieties complement each other, then it must be excessively expensive. Although for the price of a cup of cappuccino this cannot be said here. The price is normal for good coffee.\n\nHowever, the coffee they prepared for me turned out to be mediocre, not expressive and not the most delicious. And therefore, I believe, the grains used are not expensive. They are probably mixed according to the residual principle. Even Arabica.\n\nAnd it's strange. With an excellent exterior, service, selection of desserts and such a location, a coffee shop can become an academy of good taste for the average person, and not just a coffee machine to satisfy demand.\n\nThere is only one wish from #coffeenotes. Please take a careful look at your choice of grain supplier. Until then. Would I want to come here again? - No. Maybe later if something new appears.", "time": 1543948281, "translated": true}, {"author_name": "Андрей Стеклов", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116464644692333909204/reviews", "language": "en-US", "original_language": "ru", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjX6z1mF73WhmpGuvZ8CkiEGvvLFpoVqyuv5WFHdE7wKaBoL=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba5", "rating": 5, "relative_time_description": "4 years ago", "text": "Cafe Montserrat is easy to find - it is a small “island” with tables on the ground floor of the Smartplaza shopping center on Polytech.
