looks attractive, stylish and modern, it is almost always free and you can sit at a table, and all because the responsible employee divides visitors into two categories who can sit at a table and those who cannot sit at it, the rule is very simple if you sit down at a table , then you definitely have to buy something or get up and leave, so even if you need to wait for a friend or girlfriend and in the future, getting bored, you would like to buy something to pass the time, then unfortunately you will not be able to do this since you they will already urgently ask you to leave this place and you simply will not have time to feel the desire to buy something.\n\nI proposed different options for solving this situation, one of which is the following: I suggested that I would continue to sit at the table, but as soon as the visitors needed it, I would immediately leave it, to which I was told “we will be fined for this.”\n\nHaving concluded that the person who asked me to leave was not guilty of such rules, I stood up to leave the place, warning that I would leave a review on Google Maps about these stupid rules, but after that the barista (he introduced himself to me as Andrey) began to behave aggressively and began to be rude to me despite the fact that I complied with his request.\n\nSumming up this situation, I can say one thing: you will be welcome here only if you are willing to pay. Do not count on friendliness, since the request for a drink of water was also refused, citing that it was not on the menu. Although in most restaurants and cafes simply serving a glass of water is not something difficult.\n\nI also appeal to the management of this establishment through a review:\nIt is necessary to cancel the rule and employee fines associated with desks.\nBut it’s time to fine people for rudeness.\n\nBy the way, in MegaMarket, which is very close, there are many places where you can sit at a table and no one asks you to leave there. It was there that I wrote this review for 10 minutes, and then I bought coffee there, with which they offered free cookies, just like that, so think for yourself where you are welcome in any case, and where only if you are a client.\n\nI will be glad to change this review to positive after positive and friendly changes in your establishment.", "time": 1575300189, "translated": true}, {"author_name": "Maksym Frantz", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108966638024714227195/reviews", "language": "en-US", "original_language": "ru", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjUAHLb0QLGUFvDIrogFHui90KMstE0UCRInIyOOXdOcmkwj=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba5", "rating": 2, "relative_time_description": "2 years ago", "text": "I think the coffee there is delicious, the ice cream too, but it’s redneck to drive people away from the tables who just want to sit.
