The meat was well cooked, but they had obviously been forgotten about on the side of a table somewhere.\n\nWe asked the waitress to take them back and bring back hot food.\n\nBecause of the delay, we said we want to cancel the desert we had ordered. The waitress said it was not possible as the desert was ready - she brought the desert before our burgers returned....\n\nThe burgers returned and looked like they had been put in a microwave for 30 seconds. The bun was hot and so was the salad, but unfortunately they were not in the microwave for long enough, as the meat was still cold.\n\nIt is disappointing because the burgers looked like they would taste good if they were served at the correct time and not forgotten about.\n\nI have been in this country for 10 years and today was the first time I have said I can not eat the food and asked for the manager.\n\nThe manager came, and said the problem was that it was happy hour and this causes delays - however as a bar owner I simply can't accept this as it was clear the food had been cooked and forgotten about. The meat was well done/crispy/slightly burnt, but cold.\n\nThe manager removed the two burgers from our bill, leaving the drinks and desert. The cocktails here were super, and the desert was amazing. It's such a shame about the burgers, and I really think it is not the fault of the chef or kitchen staff as it was clear that they had originally been cooked properly and made well.", "time": 1641313525, "translated": false}, {"author_name": "Marián Jakubec (DJ Kypo)", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115057428968844616919/reviews", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjVSPYqm9sd9wwXymErF5Yn5i16ZevhbPgeFIbPYl8eZ1xU=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba2", "rating": 5, "relative_time_description": "2 years ago", "text": "Cheap, delicious food.
