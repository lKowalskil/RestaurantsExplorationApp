The sink must have been clogged, as it remained full of water for several seconds even after the shortest use of the water faucet.\n\nSo overall this hotel is not a bad choice for groups, especially as they have many conference rooms, and the rooms are cheaper than President next door, but they're not so good for couples or solo travelers (or for people who would like a full night of sleep).
