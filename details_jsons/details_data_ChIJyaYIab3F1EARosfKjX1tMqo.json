\"Ucha\". Aftertaste.\n\n10 minutes walk from my house, and I’m near a massive building, with an equally massive door!\n\nSpacious hall. There are several tables on the left. On the right, behind the glass door, are the workers of Khachapuri No. 1. There are no more people. By inertia I follow to the second floor.\n\nA few tables are occupied by guests, it is also spacious, and there is a comfortable distance between the tables. Several spaces are set up for a banquet, awaiting their guests. Pleasant, unobtrusive (in terms of volume) Georgian music is playing. No one greets me, I sit down at a free table.\n\nThe menu is brought slowly.\n\n— What is the weight of khinkali? - I ask the waiter.\n— The weight of the filling is 40 g, they don’t tell us anything else. And everyone does it differently.\n\nI read the menu. Below is a footnote: you can bring your own alcoholic drinks other than beer.\n\nTo take my order, I get up from the table and go up to the waitress, from whom I can’t take my eyes off. “They didn’t take your order?” - interested.\n\n— What is the weight of khinkali? - I ask.\n— With any filling, 100 grams.\n\nI wait 22 minutes for Khinkali. For a long time. But I'm alone, so time passes slowly. In addition, cooks are usually not busy during this period of the day, so the delay may be due to the boiling water for cooking. With a flow of guests, the water would constantly boil on the stove.\n\nTbilisi-style Khinkali (pork, beef, greens) - delicious. There's a little bit of salt missing, but that's not a problem.\n\nKhinkali with lamb - less salt possible. After a bite, it is not possible to hold it by the tail, they lose their shape and need to be placed on a plate. I liked that the cutlery was brought out crossed on a plate, without sets that then need to be cleaned, or disposable paper ones that are thrown away in countless quantities.\n\nKhinkali with mushrooms - a lot of salt.\n\nRecommendations to management:\n\n1. Waiters are often not present in the hall, they go to some room. Thus, guests cannot always attract the waiter's attention at the right moment. This observation applies to the time period between 14:50 and 15:20.\n\n2. At the end of the meal, no one asked “did you like everything?” This is a useful practice to help improve service.\n\n3. Post the menu in good quality on some resource. Because I was able to find the menu only in the comments under the post on Facebook dated 10.21.2023.\n\nRecommendation for guests:\n\nJust in case, tell the waiter your wishes regarding salt or other ingredients that are important to you. Unfortunately, the taste of khinkali cannot be changed, since this Caucasian dish is prepared in advance. However, waiters are often aware of the taste qualities of a particular dish; you can at least ask.\n\nConclusion:\n\nIt is felt that the owner furnished this building with love. For him, guests are not just people, but friends! Everything my gaze touched left an indelibly pleasant impression ❤️\n\n🗓 Date of visit to the restaurant (Lesnoy Avenue, 39) - 11.21.2023.", "time": 1701810257, "translated": true}, {"author_name": "Эльвира Тумарханова", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112765784437116182046/reviews", "language": "en-US", "original_language": "ru", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocJK7OBlP1HzAuVs5qXBHAfpvitZ8k8HZRYj6xkAH7WV=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo", "rating": 1, "relative_time_description": "a month ago", "text": "There are two establishments in the city of Kyiv.\nOne on Lesnoy Massif, the second near the Prospek shopping center. And these are two completely different worlds. We placed an order for pickup at 14:30 at 17:00. Unfortunate, 8 pieces of khinkali. (It was at the address Finsky Lane) And this order did not arrive on time ready. They justified this by saying that it was loading... although there were about 10 people sitting in the hall, and then with the tables already set. Khinkali was given out cold after 20 minutes of the specified time. I won’t say anything about the smell of cheap liqueur in the hall. And what a shame it was when Having already tried the cold khinkali (they were naturally not sealed), they turned out to be extremely unpalatable (although I would like to note that in Ucha on Lesnoy the food is really always tasty, well packaged and always made quickly and on time, even with a large actual load!).
