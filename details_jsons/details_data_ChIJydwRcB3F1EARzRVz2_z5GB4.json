And they asked to re-place the order by paying for it immediately through their website. Okay, no big deal, the main thing is that it should be delivered by 12:00 at the latest since it’s a working day and there’s a fixed lunch break.\nAt 11:40 there is no information about delivery, I call, and in response I hear: “As soon as we send the order by taxi, you will receive an SMS with the taxi’s arrival time.” 11:59, the taxi driver just picked up the order (I remind you that my colleagues and I expected delivery at the latest by 12:00, having specifically indicated the delivery time period of 11:30-12:00). I received an SMS that the order will arrive at 12:15. The first unpleasant moment. Okay, it's good that at least I got there.\nMy colleagues and I are unpacking the order and discover that the pizza that I ordered for myself is missing. It's on the receipt, I paid for it. I call the manager and report the problem. In response I hear: “I’ll clarify now, maybe they didn’t put it in.” “He calls back and says: “Yes, they actually counted the check, but forgot to put it in, I will return the money for the pizza, but it will be credited to the card within 5-10 days!”\nTo say that I was stunned is an understatement! I have never seen such a question posed before.\nInstead of offering me to deliver pizza as a separate order, which I paid for, but FORGOT TO PUT, they simply calmly tell me: “We will credit the money to the card within 10 days”!\nBy the way, they didn’t pick up the phone from me again. I think no money will be credited to my card. Your methods of earning money are so-so: ask to pay for the order immediately and not deliver part of it.\nI ordered 4 items from the menu!!! Not 20, but 4! It wouldn’t be a good idea to work with people who are collecting orders for delivery if out of 4 positions they lose 1! Paid.\nThe manager of this establishment has zero customer focus!!!\n\nSo you borrowed the idea of ​​pizza from the Kharkov “Buffet”, but apparently forgot to take a master class on customer focus! It wouldn't hurt though. So, in the “Buffet” in Kharkov they would never allow themselves to do this in relation to a client.\nAnd what does it mean that the money will be credited within 10 days?!\nYou asked me to pay right away, the delivery arrived later than the promised time, the order is incomplete, there is no money, they don’t answer the phone.\nThis is the worst service I have ever encountered! I will never be a customer of this establishment or their delivery service again! I will tell everyone from whom I hear the name of the establishment about their service so that they don’t think of using it. Luckily, you have plenty of competition, and you can be sure that your customers will come to them with that attitude!", "time": 1708707794, "translated": true}, {"author_name": "Ihor Pryimak", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117079337174651061814/reviews", "language": "en-US", "original_language": "uk", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocLu4lNJ1cSZIQvSYa0i2UL_qnvK9a_T0G1U0sgo6SSu=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo", "rating": 1, "relative_time_description": "2 weeks ago", "text": "Unfortunately, the burgers turned out to be inedible because of the cutlet, mustard, no taste of meat.
