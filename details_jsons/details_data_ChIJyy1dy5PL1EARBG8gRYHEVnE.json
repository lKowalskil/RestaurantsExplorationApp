They even ordered a holiday with Mavka and Lukash for their daughter. The premises, of course, are not new, but in general everything is well organized, there is no need for extra trouble, you can order a package of services and everything will be organized. The main thing is that the children like it and are satisfied.\nOnly recently, my daughter was invited to a Wednesday-style holiday. And it seems that everything is more or less, but only the animator (Wednesday) is probably a little tired of her work. When the children were asked to make an aqua painting, the daughter asked to draw her a butterfly. Wednesday reported that she could not do it. The daughter was upset, because she wanted a butterfly. To this, Wednesday replied: \"WELL SO WHAT, SHOULD I FUCK??\"\nIn the end, the butterfly was drawn by another animator. But it seems to me that this way of communication between an animator and a child at a holiday is unacceptable. Therefore, the impression of the institution is somewhat spoiled.", "time": 1684848784, "translated": true}, {"author_name": "Natali", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113746028938230035275/reviews", "language": "en-US", "original_language": "ru", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjWoqBnc-Mg8O_xzJ3IBYvWHdAWVrkpCMIhg2gf6aZXsDA=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo", "rating": 5, "relative_time_description": "2 years ago", "text": "The holiday was a success, children and parents were very pleased!
