place! Very high end classy restaurant, karaoke Lounge. The staff were all very pleasant and the crowd is very upscale. Definitely one of the more pricier establishments in Kiev. But to be honest with you, when you come to this kind of place you expect to pay more. I went on a Tuesday night and it was pretty decent in terms of being busy. But I'm sure it's far more busy on the weekends and would require a table reservation in advance. I would suggest a blazer and a button down shirt since the door man is very strict on appearance. Ladies should definitely wear heels and a nice dress. The food was amazing as well. I ordered the Caesar Salad and Chicken Carbonara. Both were exquisite. They sell hookah here as well.For more interesting reviews and places to visit check out @ricklemoinevip", "time": 1563657348, "translated": false}, {"author_name": "Anastasiya Bowdoin", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101233512374655894462/reviews", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocKuAwEJyTQEOJ6RkMCU04Wf8dGXRjWCpfhowWuH9zgG=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo", "rating": 1, "relative_time_description": "2 years ago", "text": "Very rude staff behind the bar.
