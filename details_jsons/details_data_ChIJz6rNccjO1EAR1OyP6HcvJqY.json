But I can't say the same in terms of entertainment. Only 2 girls were dancing when I went, only 3 girls in total. They also stopped dancing after a while. The dance floor was empty. The songs and dances were short. One of the girls hung out with 2 of her friends all the time. So only 2 girls were left free. The attention of the girls was at the highest level, they always bothered about the private dance. In terms of quality, unfortunately, I will speak negatively again. I tried once. I don't know if I'll try again. Most of the comments here were written by locals. After I went and saw it, I understood more clearly. The orders came very quickly. And the hostess, who took care of the orders and our entrance, was nice.

(Saturday) This used to be a favorite vacation spot, people often went there. Yesterday we came with friends to whom we praised this establishment, but throughout the evening we were left with a feeling of shame that we had brought them here. And so in order:\n1. It’s cold in the club itself, and if the air conditioning is still working in the main hall, then in the rest of the club it’s impossible to be without outerwear. There is no hot water in the restroom; you dry your hands with cold air from the dryer. The conditions are like in a free toilet at a train station.\n\n2. Many items are simply not on the menu. The selection of snacks is not wide.\n\n3. The music does not match the concept of the establishment. Sitting in the Strip on a Saturday evening under Boombox - Naodintsi is still “fun”\n\n4. Girls don’t dance because they “lost their turn” from their words. Sorry, but should I care? We arrive at the strip club, but we look at an empty stage. Sometimes someone would come out and dance around the pole with indifference. some girls don't even wear makeup. Some were not seen on stage even once during the evening.\n\n5. We decided to entertain ourselves and go to a karaoke room. You can’t go with your own group without a stripper for 3000 UAH/hour.\n\nDirector Natalya was very vigilant about every minute of our time at karaoke, but it would be better to pay attention to other moments in her club. We don't mind paying, but we have to understand why!\n\nThe club has sunk to the level of a rural eatery, from the level of the capital's Strip - only the price list.\n\nWe will not come again and do not recommend it to anyone! We regret that we came here, because for this money we could have gone to another club, where everything would have been at a different level.", "time": 1708267850, "translated": true}], "serves_beer": true, "serves_wine": true, "types": ["bar", "night_club", "point_of_interest", "establishment"], "url": "https://maps.google.com/?cid=11972308851460402388", "user_ratings_total": 84, "utc_offset": 120, "vicinity": "Maksyma Kryvonosa Street, 27, Kyiv", "website": "http://star-nosorog.com.ua/solomenka", "wheelchair_accessible_entrance": false}, "status": "OK"}
