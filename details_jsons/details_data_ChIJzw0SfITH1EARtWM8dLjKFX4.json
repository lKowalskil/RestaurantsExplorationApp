cottage for 3 days. The complex itself is well-kept, you can see what they are doing. The cottage is clean, not \"early\", everything is beautiful and tasteful. There are cosmetics, bathrobes, slippers, they bring water every day - 2 bottles of 0.5 l each. On the territory there are 2 swimming pools - children's shallow and adult, there is a children's playground, table tennis and billiards. There is a place to walk. The food in the restaurant is delicious, in 3 days we tasted a lot of dishes, because we didn't take anything from home, we liked everything. The overall impression is positive, but…\nIn my opinion, there is not enough of a person at the pool to keep order. There is a smoking area, but some people were smoking on the sunbeds and near the bungalows.\nAlso, when booking, we were told that dogs are allowed and no nuances were voiced. But after the first day of rest, it turned out that the dog should be left in the house. But there are stairs in the house and it is not safe to leave our 2 kg dog, because he can climb the stairs and fall. Well, in general, most vacationers did not even notice our dog. He is smaller than a cat, he just slept on a couch or was in your arms, did not go anywhere and did not cling to anyone.\nNow we have a reservation for September and I don't know what to do. Maybe you will reconsider these rules and allow small polite dogs to sleep on the deckchair)?", "time": 1692179776, "translated": true}, {"author_name": "Svitlana Styopochkina", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114034250601989553093/reviews", "language": "en-US", "original_language": "uk", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjW0B5ASnQupJVT4Kyx-AU0kqHUwSYheZWYHmeBBqDqEs6kr=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba4", "rating": 5, "relative_time_description": "8 months ago", "text": "I liked everything very much.
